To follow the design group’s projects, head to Instagram and Twitter, and watch the robotic creatures in action on YouTube.","guid":"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/?p=134658","categories":["Design","DIY","dogs","robots"],"isoDate":"2020-09-04T14:29:20.000Z","source":"Colossal","formattedDate":"September 4, 2020","image":"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/petoi-3.jpg"},{"creator":"CLOT Magazine","title":"Immersive screenings: MIRA.mov by MIRA Festival in Barcelona","link":"https://www.clotmag.com/news/immersive-screenings-mira-mov-by-mira-festival-in-barcelona","pubDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 12:34:58 +0000","dc:creator":"CLOT Magazine","content":"<p>MIRA Festival in Barcelona is another of the festivals reinventing themselves in this transitional (hopefully) year.

Including both sprawling site-specific installations and smaller pieces confined to a few dozen centimeters, the São Paulo-based artist&#8217;s body of work is broad. All of her projects, though, explore tension and space as they spread into arboreal forms or perfectly round networks.</p>\n<p>Her recent works include a massive tree-like installation that fans out across <a href=\"https://www.zippergaleria.com.br/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zipper Gallery</a>’s floor and walls into delicate, tape blossoms. Another is a smaller, numbered piece that was born from the artist&#8217;s response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  &#8220;My days are quite slow now, no more assistants around, but I’m still working and thinking a lot,&#8221; she shares with Colossal and notes that at the beginning of lockdowns, she completed &#8220;Ciclotrama 177 (Fibonacci),&#8221; which is shown below.</p>\n<p>Since 2010, Landini has been contributing to her <em>Ciclotrama</em> series, a moniker that defines each piece. &#8220;The social cartography of individual networks shows the infinite interconnectedness of personal trajectories throughout a system, society, and the world as a whole. The movement of bodies (ropes) and the relationship between rhythm and time are also fundamental aspects of these series,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>To dive further into Landini&#8217;s work, check out her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/janainamello/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/janaina-mello-landini\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artsy</a>, and take <a href=\"https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=UdbWuodLo1L\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a virtual tour</a> of her recent show at <a href=\"https://www.zippergaleria.com.br/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zipper Gallery</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_134608\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-134608\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-134608 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1199\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8.jpg 1200w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-640x639.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-960x959.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-768x767.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-624x623.jpg 624w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-1104x1104.jpg 1104w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-912x912.jpg 912w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-550x550.jpg 550w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-470x470.jpg 470w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-150x150@2x.jpg 300w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-50x50@2x.jpg 100w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-550x550@2x.jpg 1100w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/landini-8-470x470@2x.jpg 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-134608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Ciclotrama 177 (Fibonacci)&#8221; (2020), cotton threads and acrylic pen on canvas, 1.7 x 1.7 meters.

Another is a smaller, numbered piece that was born from the artist’s response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  “My days are quite slow now, no more assistants around, but I’m still working and thinking a lot,” she shares with Colossal and notes that at the beginning of lockdowns, she completed “Ciclotrama 177 (Fibonacci),” which is shown below.\nSince 2010, Landini has been contributing to her Ciclotrama series, a moniker that defines each piece. “The social cartography of individual networks shows the infinite interconnectedness of personal trajectories throughout a system, society, and the world as a whole. The movement of bodies (ropes) and the relationship between rhythm and time are also fundamental aspects of these series,” she says.\nTo dive further into Landini’s work, check out her Instagram or Artsy, and take a virtual tour of her recent show at Zipper Gallery.\n \n\n“Ciclotrama 177 (Fibonacci)” (2020), cotton threads and acrylic pen on canvas, 1.7 x 1.7 meters.

Part of an ongoing Segmentation Series, the composite works consider the evolution of a single cell, which Lee expands on:\nI work with glass that has transparency and translucency, two qualities that serve as perfect metaphors for what is known and unknown about life science. The segmented, geometrical forms of my work represent cells, embryos, biological and molecular structures—each symbolizing the building blocks of life as well as the starting point of life.\n\nLee is based in Carbondale, Illinois, where he teaches at Southern Illinois University, and many of the pieces shown here will be part of a group show at Duane Reed Gallery in St. Louis from September 12 to October 17, 2020. The artist also was chosen as one of 30 artists for the Loewe Foundation’s Craft Prize, which will bring him to Paris for an exhibition in the spring of 2021. Until then, explore more of Lee’s biology-informed sculptures on Artsy.\n \n\n“Mitosis” (2010), cut, color (white) laminated, carved glass, 8.6 x 13 x 14 inches\n\n\n“Diatom segmentation” (2019), cut, color laminated, carved, hot formed glass, 7 x 10 x 7 inches\n\n\n“Black and White Diatom Segmentation” (2020), hot sculpted, cut, color laminated, carved, glass, 8 × 12 × 8 inches\n\n\n\nLeft: “Gray Diatom Segmentation” (2018), cut, color laminated, carved glass, 5 1/4 × 12 1/2 inches.

Otherwise, find out more about what he has planned for the rest of the year, which includes a new solar-powered balloon, on his site and Instagram. (via This Isn’t Happiness)\n \n\n“Thermodynamic Constellation”\n\n\n“Flying Gardens,” (2020), Tillandsia plants and hand-blown glass\n\n\n“Thermodynamic Constellation”\n\n\n“Thermodynamic Constellation”\n\n\n“Aerographies,” by Studio Tomás Saraceno\n\n\n“Connectome”\n\n\n“A Thermodynamic Imaginary”","guid":"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/?p=134508","categories":["Art","air","balloons","climate change","glass","installation","light","mirrors","plants"],"isoDate":"2020-09-01T21:36:11.000Z","source":"Colossal","formattedDate":"September 2, 2020","image":"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saraceno-1.jpg"},{"creator":"Grace Ebert","title":"Layered Botanics Comprise Artist Vanessa Hogge’s Delicate Porcelain Assemblages","link":"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/09/vanessa-hogge-efflorescence/","pubDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 18:58:45 +0000","content:encoded":"<div id=\"attachment_134496\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-134496\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-134496 size-full\" src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hogge-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1373\" srcset=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hogge-5.jpg 1200w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hogge-5-640x732.jpg 640w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hogge-5-960x1098.jpg 960w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hogge-5-768x879.jpg 768w, https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hogge-5-624x714.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-134496\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">All images © Vanessa Hogge, courtesy of Ester Segarra/Vessel Gallery, shared with permission</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://vanessahogge.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanessa Hogge</a> translates her lifelong fascination with flowers into monochromatic assemblages of hydrangeas, roses, and myriad blossoms.

However, few artists can regularly create works that evoke feelings of awe and wonder on that level in its viewers. Even fewer artists have managed to do this by writing code on a computer, a tool which many consider to be at odds with natural beauty, and sometimes even nature itself. </p><p class=\"\">Among generative artists, Jared Tarbell is singular in his ability to continuously create works that rival nature in both their complexity and grace. He has been doing so for decades. Tarbell’s work is beyond timeless. The images he created in the early 2000s still feel like they are light years ahead of where we are with generative art today. </p><p class=\"\">It was Tarbell’s work that turned me from a bratty young studio art major who dismissed all digital art into a lifelong advocate for generative art. I have written about <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art\"><span>Jared’s work</span></a> for years. I’ve also included his pieces in <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/10/21/augmenting-creativity-decoding-ai-and-generative-art\"><span>exhibitions</span></a> that I’ve curated around the world. However, I never had the opportunity to speak with Jared personally until now. </p><p class=\"\">It turns out Jared does not do very many interviews, which made this an especially great honor for me. Early in the interview, I discovered that, like myself, Jared was raised Mormon and has since left the faith. While I left that out of the interview, it gave me important insight. I see Jared’s work as the reconciliation of the intrinsic spirituality of the church and the inherent logic of computer science. This is a childhood experience that I personally know very well.  I believe that through his art — and particularly, his embrace of emergence — Jared seeks to find harmony between the seemingly oppositional forces of the spiritual and the rational. <br><br>Our interview comes in the context of the show “<a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/7/12/the-game-of-life-emergence-in-generative-art\">The Game of Life - Emergence in Generative Art</a>,” currently running online at the <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/\">Kate Vass Galerie</a>. The show explores the concept that very simple systems or sets of rules can explain much of the complex behavior we see in the world around us. This idea of ‘complexity evolving from simplicity’ is core to Jared’s work.</p><p class=\"\">I am thrilled to contribute to the relatively small amount of literature on this incredibly important but private artist.&nbsp;Enjoy!</p><h2>Interview </h2><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason Bailey:</strong> Jared, I consider myself the president of your unofficial fan club.&nbsp; I’ve looked for recent interviews on you and your work for years and not much has come up. </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared Tarbell:</strong> Let me tell you, I really admire you. I think I’ve read most of everything you’ve written. And, you know, I don’t do interviews, and I’ve got a lot of requests. Most people want to talk about Etsy and how to create a billion-dollar startup. [<strong><em>Interviewer’s note</em></strong><em>: Tarbell co-founded the online retailer Etsy in 2005.</em>] So doing this interview is a rare thing, and I’m really happy that I get to talk to you. </p><p class=\"\">That’s maybe why there isn’t too much history or too many recent interviews on me, because I’ve realized with a little bit of public attention that I don’t enjoy it. I really do like being kind of private with my life and my work, because I don’t really don’t take myself that seriously. It’s really your perspective and your insights that’s compelled me to do this interview.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason Bailey:</strong> Wow, thanks, that really means a lot to me. </p><p class=\"\">I’d like to start by asking a question I ask a lot of generative artists. Did you come from math to art or from art to math? Or were they parallel interests that kind of drove each other?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598188743895-P1H51C8E56P5XZE1VHLX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNJDN8tC-0G0L_Kg7V0XzqlZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpw5Ho9DnMU3W_UrhsZ42upAy4y5m44SJqBAz6I50hOxG2bFOnMEEvMHuwR6TTW50fw/Bubble.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"597x597\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jared Tarbell,  Bubble Chamber , 2003, Processing sketch\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f42c2e285783706be3763d1\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598188743895-P1H51C8E56P5XZE1VHLX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNJDN8tC-0G0L_Kg7V0XzqlZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpw5Ho9DnMU3W_UrhsZ42upAy4y5m44SJqBAz6I50hOxG2bFOnMEEvMHuwR6TTW50fw/Bubble.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jared Tarbell, <em>Bubble Chamber</em>, 2003, Processing sketch</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Jared:</strong> Great question. I was encouraged to make art in the home by my mother quite a bit. But my background in college was mathematics and computer science, so I really viewed the world that way. I also wasn’t afraid to try to express myself or try to find beauty in computation. I tend to view the world computationally — the idea that this world is a very complex system and that it’s hard to try to identify the rules that are driving it. It’s just some kind of natural phenomenon that we don’t understand.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">But in reality, you can break the world down into these very simple rules that interact on orders of magnitude beyond what we’re capable of imagining. It’s a result of this phenomenon, this emergent phenomenon. I don’t know if it describes everything. In fact, I kind of don’t believe it does. I think there still are some very spiritual, mysterious elements to the universe. But certainly, thinking about problems computationally, you can get pretty far in understanding what’s actually happening.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason:</strong> That’s really insightful. So did your interests in programming start in college?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared:</strong> I was programming at the age of 14. My dad brought home a computer from the labs. It was, like, a Sanyo 8088. And more importantly, he taught me how to program in BASIC really simple little things such as number guessing games, like the game Battleship where you pick a number and it’s higher or lower. I eventually moved on to Pascal and created a two-player version of Tetris. You can actually still find it online. I think it’s called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B22LFVrVFNQ\">Atomic Tetris</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598125360557-8O7P97JIEE7ZKR21261F/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIIWdAnyBSrZ5E6Gv7JXlDh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0nqf2HYKlysnoifqMU5NjJx7yqCGE_I8MD34_rHhpOCXJXL4amoIyEjBbTEx2gJ8RA/Jared_Tarbell_Atomic_Tetris.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1563\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jared Tarbell,  Atomic Tetris , 1991\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f42c2e285783706be3763d4\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598125360557-8O7P97JIEE7ZKR21261F/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIIWdAnyBSrZ5E6Gv7JXlDh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0nqf2HYKlysnoifqMU5NjJx7yqCGE_I8MD34_rHhpOCXJXL4amoIyEjBbTEx2gJ8RA/Jared_Tarbell_Atomic_Tetris.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jared Tarbell, <em>Atomic Tetris</em>, 1991</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">So I was really into computers, and I knew that I wanted to study computers in college. In fact, I sold one of my first games — that Atomic Tetris — to a software bundler.  They sold software bundled with new computers. It was Packard Bell at Montgomery Ward. You would get this collection of games. It paid me a few thousand dollars, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but at the time, it was huge. That’s like a few thousand dollars before college. It helped me pay for my tuition the first couple of years.</p><p class=\"\">I studied computer science right away, eventually learned all the languages they force you to learn in college — C, Pascal, and Miranda and COBAL. But there was no web work.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">I really wasn’t working as an artist. I was interested in making video games. That’s what the gateway question was for me. How do I create video games? Because they were just so fun at the time!</p><p class=\"\">Then getting out of college, I realized the web was really coming up, and I really wanted to make a web page. Just something, but I didn’t understand what it was yet. And I really wasn’t creating these algorithms — like, these drawing machines that I think I’ve become well known for — until later when I discovered <a href=\"https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/\"><span>Edward Tufte</span></a>. </p><p class=\"\">I was a computer programmer like most computer programmers, making just the ugliest websites you can really imagine. Functionally perfect, working and taking your data, but just really hard to use and ugly. And one of my early employers sent me to an Edward Tufte conference and said, “Jared, just go spend the day listening to this guy.” You’re familiar with him?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason: </strong>Yes! I never thought about it, but I can see how your color palette may have been influenced by Tufte?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared: </strong>Yes. Absolutely. And so many of my design aesthetics came from him. He breaks down design with visual rules. My very analytical mind at first says, well, okay, if I’m making a grid, I don’t need to draw the grid. I just need to draw the elements. And instantly, it was like, wow, that actually looks really good.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598126256182-6GS18AE02PQT1K0DHGBW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDxuS5YfoqzeE-tN2s_saCBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI4kJkrjavBJktKI3UnAGNNhGljY3Vr7aPkrREGp1VpHcKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/sandDollarPRN.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"780x560\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jared Tarbell,  Sand Dollar,  2004, Processing sketch\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f42c2e285783706be3763d7\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598126256182-6GS18AE02PQT1K0DHGBW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDxuS5YfoqzeE-tN2s_saCBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI4kJkrjavBJktKI3UnAGNNhGljY3Vr7aPkrREGp1VpHcKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/sandDollarPRN.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jared Tarbell, <em>Sand Dollar, </em>2004, Processing sketch</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Jared</strong>: Another particularly powerful lesson I learned from Tufte was small multiples, which applies to generative systems. You can build this machine that generates an infinite number of forms, but all very similar forms. But how do you show what the machine is doing to people? The way to do that is by just laying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple\">small multiples</a> right next to each other. When the outputs of the machine are all next to each other, you get an idea that this is a system — this isn’t a single image. I think it was after I applied Tufte’s rules and I started writing these programs that were actually creating beautiful output, that’s when I thought, well, maybe there’s room for art here.</p><p class=\"\">Also, I was really harsh on artists. I thought, oh, look at these guys, these artists are so selfish. They’re just doing what they want to do and expressing their view of the world, and really not contributing to the world at large. I thought, what good is this? These artists are just indulging themselves. So I really stayed away from the realm of art, and I never wanted to be called an artist for a long time because I had a more functional view on how I wanted to contribute. I wanted to build a wall or a spacecraft or something of this nature. I didn’t want to inspire or ask questions about the nature of the universe. Which, of course, is all I do now.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason: </strong>[laughs] So what changed you from your artist-hating younger self?<br><br><strong>Jared:</strong> I think seeing the impact that art can have on a person, or even have on a field. I applied some of these artistic concepts to some of my early work on Etsy. We needed a tool to shop, and I thought, well, let’s apply some of these artistic values to this tool. And seeing just how powerful that was — you know, it helps sell items, one very real thing. So I thought maybe it’s okay, because here’s actually some function that comes from it. </p><p class=\"\">Also, finding artists and being influenced by artists myself.

Etsy was definitely a super-full-time gig. Wake up, before I even got dressed I would check some of the site’s stats, respond to people in the forums, and basically work on the site throughout the entire day. In the beginning, I remember sometimes I would have conflicts with some of the other engineers or my other co-founders, Haim Schoppik and Chris Maguire. We’d get into arguments about the best practice or best way forward, and I would also fall back on my <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo\"><span>Alexa page ranking</span></a> of Complexification. It was ranked higher than Etsy at that point. So I was thinking, I’ve got this art website that’s outperforming Etsy. I could just go back to this. You guys better get in line. [laughs]</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason:</strong> [laughs]&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Jared: </strong>But, you know, we all worked together really well. Very quickly, after about the second year, Etsy eclipsed Complexification in terms of the number of people that were interacting with it, the number of people we were reaching, and the amount of time I was spending on it. Complexification just kind of dies around 2005. There’s actually a sketch called <em>Colony</em> that I was working on and didn’t quite finish, and I put this little tag on it that said “soon.” And that’s still there to this day. I’ve never actually returned to that site to finish some of those sketches. It wasn’t until I left Etsy in 2011 that I was really able to return to my art.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason:</strong> Then, in 2011, when you come back to your art, is that when you build out the Levitated workshop?

I was living in the country, pretty remote. I bought this old building and renovated it. I was really interested in this laser cutter that I bought at the time. It’s part of my trying to get my work off of the screen and into some more tangible, physical form. I thought I’d wrap a company around it, like Lego, where we would create some kind of a building system that was open-ended and used a lot of these algorithmic techniques. </p><p class=\"\">I called that site <a href=\"http://levitated.guru/\">Levitated.guru</a>, so I used the new top-level domain “dot guru.” It just kind of froze — that’s what I tend to do. I just freeze the sites that I’ve worked on in the past. So Levitated.net today looks a lot like it did back in 2000. Same with Complexification.</p><p class=\"\">And the Levitated Toy Factory lasted a couple of years, about 18 months. I don’t know if you want to get into that. But running a company is really difficult. I found that what I was doing every day was just managing the books and the people, and I really didn’t have any time to do any of the creative work that I would like. So with the birth of my second daughter, I used that as a great excuse to just close the door to the Toy Factory and devote myself really to my family at first, and then slowly, as the babies grow and you have a little more time to yourself, that’s when I’ve started to get back into the artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598187315360-5GWCC80YBXHP802VBEXI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPgZ1Lut4L8h_7losRMIE9F7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UU5ysU5LQg4zempt61WlJHUUcQ5VucDv5IZyy_0oqLXB7zs2yPjc1ECvpa5Zm_kMqw/Screen+Shot+2020-08-23+at+8.54.33+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1546x1538\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jared Tarbell,  Wilson Maze , 2019, Baltic birch, acrylic paint\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f42c2e285783706be3763e3\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598187315360-5GWCC80YBXHP802VBEXI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPgZ1Lut4L8h_7losRMIE9F7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UU5ysU5LQg4zempt61WlJHUUcQ5VucDv5IZyy_0oqLXB7zs2yPjc1ECvpa5Zm_kMqw/Screen+Shot+2020-08-23+at+8.54.33+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jared Tarbell, <em>Wilson Maze</em>, 2019, Baltic birch, acrylic paint</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Jason: </strong>You have a new site that I recently discovered.

I’ve realized that I’m in this position where I can do almost anything I want to do. But what I really want to do is just write code and share it with people. So that’s what I’m doing. The sketches that are on infinite.center are mostly drawing machines. And I haven’t really found a way to incorporate some of the laser cutting work that I’ve done. It’s hard to share those projects. I almost want to keep it pure code versus code and assembly, you know, which is the laser work. And I haven’t figured out a way to share that work.</p><p class=\"\">So this is how I spend my day. I think of an algorithm and I spend a couple of days working on it and try to get it to a point aesthetically where I’m relatively happy with it, and I post that. I’ve also committed myself to open-sourcing every project henceforth until my death, I hope. Which is difficult to do. It’s actually really easy to write a program and share some images or video of it, but to actually go and open the source code, you know, it’s a little terrifying to do that because you’re not secure — I’m not secure, necessarily, with everything I write. I’m not the best programmer. And it’s also a lot of technical work to get everything just right, upload it to GitHub, or even to find the platform that’s necessary to share the work. That’s what I’m trying to do now.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason: </strong>I want to ask you follow-up questions on your process. I think <a href=\"https://reas.com/\">Casey Reas</a> and a few other artists have mentioned that the algorithm or the core structure of what they make actually goes relatively quickly. However, it’s the tinkering, tweaking, and the adjustments that can take days, weeks, or months. I wonder is that true for you?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared: </strong>Yeah. I love that.

The core functionality of an algorithm comes together really quickly if you’re lucky, within a matter of days, usually. But then finding the expression or what you want to present with that algorithm to kind of explain the process, that takes a lot more time. </p><p class=\"\">Part of the problem is, there are so many choices — because you’ve built this parameterized system which is multivariate there’s anywhere from three to a hundred different variables that you can tweak to affect the output of this program. And so one program really can express itself in a dozen or more different ways, each with something that is aesthetically unique. So finding the right one or finding the particular parameter set that you want to display or share with the world, that takes a long time. It’s hard because sometimes you have to abandon a pretty cool idea or a pretty cool expression to move into what you think might be even more interesting.

There’s the semantics of the program — what are you actually trying to do logically — and then the syntax of the program — how are the characters arranged, how does everything flow together.</p><p class=\"\">Syntax I don’t think is very important for anyone to understand, unless they want to have a career in computer programming or if they want to do it themselves. But the semantics, understanding the logic, I think that’s important because it gives a person a lot of insight into what’s going on around them.</p><p class=\"\">So let’s look at the algorithm <em>Substrate</em>. You can understand the semantics of that program very easily. Like, this is the rule, it’s what’s happening. There’s a line that goes straight until it hits another line or the edge of the screen, and then new lines form at right angles to existing lines. That’s all you need to know. There are just two rules. And then watching the whole system unfold, I think it gives you an idea of the potential depth. It’s just this really simple thing that’s operating, but look at the complexity of the results that are being generated.</p><p class=\"\">The best algorithms that I’ve created are the ones where the semantics are easily understood or described.

It’s one of my favorites. It reminds me of the cracks in the desert. Was that your inspiration?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared: </strong><em>Substrate</em> is one of my most popular algorithms. I was sitting in a coffee shop in Santa Fe and there was a sticker in the window blasted by the sun. It separated into these cracks. I saw the algorithm there and then and wrote it in that coffee shop. The desert sun is brutal and did that.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jason:</strong> Wow, I love that story! I’ll never look at <em>Substrate</em> the same.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Given that you look at the world sort of computationally and that you have, I think, a strong understanding of what we’re calling the “semantics,” are there a fair amount of surprises as you’re creating your work when you execute your code? Do you have a blueprint in your head that you are executing on or is it more non-linear and improvisational than that? </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared:</strong> That’s a great question. I actually look for the surprises because I’ve been programming the computer for so long, it can get really boring. Like the number-sorting algorithm. There’s an algorithm that’s going to sort numbers. There are a hundred algorithms that sort numbers. But in the end, the numbers are always just in order. That’s not very exciting.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">And so when I discovered emergence and some of these generative algorithms that produce surprising results, that got me really excited. Finally I was using this incredible machine with these ideas, and I don’t exactly know what the outcome’s going to be. I have an idea, but it’s not until you run the program, and then it unfolds before you. It’s like, wow, this is really interesting. So I search out the surprises.</p><p class=\"\">I’ve found some particular classes of algorithms that generate those surprises quite easily. They’re usually systems that involve many simple elements that are allowed to somehow interact with each other. And then you just let the system unfold. You always have an idea of what you’re trying to do, but it isn’t until you run the program and see it unfold that you see the results.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598197786608-HI9UCRCX6XKBVNOM1G85/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kByci4R2Br5gVKJdGzxYHOx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmv1ihXzK27xJYOPbUG3fJTwXlk6VOOYibWzEyvAwbEqvABhgEA0eE4domEd3iDhKa/Spiritual_Noise_Machine.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1047x1047\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jared Tarbell,  Spiritual Noise Machine , 2019, Processing sketch\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5f42c2e285783706be3763f2\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1598197786608-HI9UCRCX6XKBVNOM1G85/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kByci4R2Br5gVKJdGzxYHOx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmv1ihXzK27xJYOPbUG3fJTwXlk6VOOYibWzEyvAwbEqvABhgEA0eE4domEd3iDhKa/Spiritual_Noise_Machine.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jared Tarbell, <em>Spiritual Noise Machine</em>, 2019, Processing sketch</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Jason: </strong>I’m going to have to wind down in a little bit, thank you for being so generous with your time!</p><p class=\"\">I always like to ask, are there some things that I haven’t asked about that maybe you would want to share or that you think folks would find interesting that maybe people don’t know about you?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Jared: </strong>Well, not so much about me, but a lot of people ask me, “How do you become a good programmer and create meaningful work?” My advice is always this.

Happy Place. 2004, Processing Sketch\nAt its best, art is transcendent and sublime. However, few artists can regularly create works that evoke feelings of awe and wonder on that level in its viewers. Even fewer artists have managed to do this by writing code on a computer, a tool which many consider to be at odds with natural beauty, and sometimes even nature itself. \nAmong generative artists, Jared Tarbell is singular in his ability to continuously create works that rival nature in both their complexity and grace. He has been doing so for decades. Tarbell’s work is beyond timeless. The images he created in the early 2000s still feel like they are light years ahead of where we are with generative art today. \nIt was Tarbell’s work that turned me from a bratty young studio art major who dismissed all digital art into a lifelong advocate for generative art. I have written about Jared’s work for years. I’ve also included his pieces in exhibitions that I’ve curated around the world. However, I never had the opportunity to speak with Jared personally until now. \nIt turns out Jared does not do very many interviews, which made this an especially great honor for me. Early in the interview, I discovered that, like myself, Jared was raised Mormon and has since left the faith. While I left that out of the interview, it gave me important insight. I see Jared’s work as the reconciliation of the intrinsic spirituality of the church and the inherent logic of computer science. This is a childhood experience that I personally know very well.  I believe that through his art — and particularly, his embrace of emergence — Jared seeks to find harmony between the seemingly oppositional forces of the spiritual and the rational. \nOur interview comes in the context of the show “The Game of Life - Emergence in Generative Art,” currently running online at the Kate Vass Galerie. The show explores the concept that very simple systems or sets of rules can explain much of the complex behavior we see in the world around us. This idea of ‘complexity evolving from simplicity’ is core to Jared’s work.\nI am thrilled to contribute to the relatively small amount of literature on this incredibly important but private artist. Enjoy!\nInterview \nJason Bailey: Jared, I consider myself the president of your unofficial fan club.  I’ve looked for recent interviews on you and your work for years and not much has come up. \nJared Tarbell: Let me tell you, I really admire you. I think I’ve read most of everything you’ve written. And, you know, I don’t do interviews, and I’ve got a lot of requests. Most people want to talk about Etsy and how to create a billion-dollar startup. [Interviewer’s note: Tarbell co-founded the online retailer Etsy in 2005.] So doing this interview is a rare thing, and I’m really happy that I get to talk to you. \nThat’s maybe why there isn’t too much history or too many recent interviews on me, because I’ve realized with a little bit of public attention tha...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5f42c2e285783706be3763f4","isoDate":"2020-08-27T09:26:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"August 27, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"CLOT Magazine","title":"JULIA NIZAMUTDINOVA, shaping and creating digital worlds","link":"https://www.clotmag.com/interviews/julia-nizamutdinova-shaping-and-creating-digital-worlds","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 10:42:32 +0000","dc:creator":"CLOT Magazine","content":"<p>The digital space is limitless.

Growing up, I loved studying art. I frequently sketched and painted from nature. However, I developed a math phobia early on and never saw what, for many, is the obvious thread between the worlds of art, math, and nature. </p><p class=\"\">That changed when I started to write code in graduate school and learned about three new topics within a few weeks of each other:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art\">Generative art</a></p></li><li><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">John Horton Conway’s Game of Life</a></p></li><li><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">Cellular automata</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence\">emergence</a>   </p></li></ul><p class=\"\">These three interrelated discoveries completely changed my world view by showing me that much of the complexity we find in nature can be simulated and emulated using relatively basic algorithms.</p><p class=\"\">This exhibition explores the idea of creating great complexity from deceptively simple algorithms or rule sets through the art of four generative artists: <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/alexander-reben\">Alexander Reben</a>, <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/manolo-gamboa-naon\">Manolo Gamboa Naon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/kjetil-golid\">Kjetil Golid</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/jared-tarbell\">Jared Tarbell</a>. But before we jump into their art, let’s first define generative art, emergence, cellular automata, and the Game of Life. </p><p class=\"\">Generative art is art that leverages a non-human, autonomous system which can help generate features in the artwork that would otherwise be left up to the artist to decide. In this exhibition, we are talking specifically about generative art written in computer code that includes elements of emergence or emergent behavior.  </p><p class=\"\">Emergence happens when two or more things come together to form something larger that has different properties than would be expected from the sum of the parts. Think of an ant colony. Each ant is pretty dumb, defenseless, and guided by very basic rules. But when combined with the many other ants in the colony, a new intelligence emerges at the colony level that allows them to adapt, defend themselves, and find food. The sophisticated emergent behavior of the colony cannot be predicted by understanding the limited capabilities of the individual ants. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)\">Flocks of birds</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling\">schools of fish</a> operate in a similar manner, following a set of simple rules locally that result in complex behaviors globally. Emergence is not limited to our animal friends. <a href=\"https://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/EmergentBehavior.htm#:~:text=Emergent%20behavior%20is%20behavior%20of,of%20a%20system's%20individual%20parts.\">Humans</a> are a byproduct of emergent behavior, as is our <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl_3/7191\">economy</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3410/03-ever-nf.html\">weather</a>, and <a href=\"http://udel.edu/~mm/traffic/\">traffic</a>.  </p><p class=\"\">Artists, mathematicians, and computer scientists often generate their own complex emergent “ant colony-like” systems using a large grid of simple black and white squares called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">cellular automata</a>. One of the most famous models of cellular automation is John Horton <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591670591201-O45FLF2J4G6X38WXYFLS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOdJA6hJ18ZDLLPQAJRCgboUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKc7vrUBatrMeIKU4dNRLCQ5nPziEQvBu8CyHcdsbxL6xa2HCYIqKa1eFhmp8mtn5zx/ConwayGameOfLife_KelvinBrodie_SunNews.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1000x660\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"John Conway playing the Game of Life in 1974.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee5468e27fc162ae107c098\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591670591201-O45FLF2J4G6X38WXYFLS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOdJA6hJ18ZDLLPQAJRCgboUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKc7vrUBatrMeIKU4dNRLCQ5nPziEQvBu8CyHcdsbxL6xa2HCYIqKa1eFhmp8mtn5zx/ConwayGameOfLife_KelvinBrodie_SunNews.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">John Conway playing the Game of Life in 1974.</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">First published in the October, 1970 edition of <a href=\"https://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html\">Scientific American</a>,  the game is comprised of a grid of cells that, based on a few simple rules, either die or multiply, forming complex patterns. The rules are as follows:</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\">Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</p></li></ol><p class=\"\">Through emergence, these very basic rules trigger surprisingly complex behaviors that can make a small set of black and white squares on a grid appear to \"come to life.\" </p><p class=\"\">Below is a example of the Game of Life I quickly programmed in <a href=\"https://processing.org/\">Processing</a> based on a tutorial by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg&amp;vl=en\">Daniel Shiffman</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592233649594-7UQA8NZSNXMZWX86FIWN/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGVAqUhYrGdhEGudzFls7K1Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI3qfRO8hJhbvfRCvNhjqrGe-PfXgVTpsvEoluIBTyvM0/JB_Game_of_Life.gif\" data-image-dimensions=\"800x400\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"JB_Game_of_Life.gif\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee78eaeb6ca7a797376f5e2\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592233649594-7UQA8NZSNXMZWX86FIWN/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGVAqUhYrGdhEGudzFls7K1Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI3qfRO8hJhbvfRCvNhjqrGe-PfXgVTpsvEoluIBTyvM0/JB_Game_of_Life.gif?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">After playing with the Game of Life, I and many others get a feeling that everything, no matter how complicated and mysterious it appears to be on the surface, may also be reducible to a basic set of algorithms. For artists, cellular automata like Game of Life can inspire them to improvise on these systems or to model emergent systems of their own, rivaling nature in their complexity, beauty, and surprise.</p><p class=\"\">In his work <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/print/rz3k642k7p398lg47bxgr9mwzbm5m2\"><em>puritan_communion</em></a>, artist <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/alexander-reben\">Alexander Reben</a> plays with the rules of the Game of Life, cleverly programing in new rules that change the colors of the squares over time instead of using the traditional black and white color scheme. He explains: </p><blockquote><p class=\"\">In regular Game of Life, a cell can be either \"alive\" or \"dead.\" In the case of the code, that means black or white. In this version, the&nbsp;colors&nbsp;are created by storing a history of the \"world\" wherein a new cell becomes yellow when \"alive,\" and when that cell \"dies,\" it changes&nbsp;color&nbsp;over time,&nbsp;eventually becoming black again.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">The results remind me visually of a mix between a stop-motion video of flowers blooming in a garden and an intergalactic shootout between alien spaceships.

Boxie could only perform simple actions, but when you put all of those actions together, the robot appeared to be alive and intelligent. Boxie relates to Conway's Game of Life in that the actual programming and sensors required to make it appear alive were quite simple. </p><p class=\"\">Obviously, neither Boxie nor the Game of Life are actually alive. However, there is something in our psychology that makes us think that they could be. As Reben explains:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Conway's Game of Life is more like half psychology and half math. We, as humans, are interpreting the actions of these pixels as having agency of some sort. We are picturing them as alive. Algorithms are only part of it. It is a human algorithm because it is our interpretation of what it is doing. I think that also plugs into viewing art. A lot of art is about how we interpret it in our own context. I bet a dog would interpret Conway's Game of Life differently than we do.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">We will dive much deeper into Reben's fascinating work and share our full interview with the artist in the coming months. Let's take a look at how a second generative artist interprets Conway's Game of Life.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Argentine artist <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/manolo-gamboa-naon\">Manolo Gamboa Naon</a>, better known as “<a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/generative-art-finds-its-prodigy\">Manolo</a>,” is one of my <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/generative-art-finds-its-prodigy\">favorite generative artists</a> working today. He is a masterful colorist and a seemingly bottomless well of brilliant and engaging generative art. For <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/manolo-gamboa-naon\">his three interpretations of the Game of Life</a>,  Manolo layered several versions of the game playing out simultaneously, giving the illusion of depth and increasing its visual intricacy and dynamism. As Manolo explains:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">I love when simple rules become really complex ... I feel that they even explain the world in a very reduced way. The videos that I made are several layers of Game of Life with different sizes. At first, I wanted to explore the patterns that remain static, live for a while, and reach a point where they do not mutate anymore ... and disappear with time, and new ones appear. </p><p class=\"\">I made this work as a video because it seems that time is an essential element in the Game of Life. Initially, I thought to use Game of Life to find interesting images (there are aspects that remind me of a lot of pixel art -- I can't stop seeing characters from Space Invaders). But ultimately, I think \"life\" appears with movement/evolution/time. So I liked the idea of having two moments. First, they evolve and come alive, and then they die and disappear, and in time others are born, on and on like this forever.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">The Game of Life is only one particular model of cellular automata. It is unique in that it is two dimensional and unfolds frame by frame over time, producing what looks like an animation. Unlike the Game of Life, <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html\">one-dimensional (or elementary) cellular automata</a> are designed based on rows.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In elementary cellular automata, each cell still changes based on the \"on/off\" state of its neighbors. However, instead of eight neighbors, the cell changes based on just three cells: The cell to its upper left, the cell directly above, and the cell to its top right. The row below is then created based on whether those neighbors are on or off. This sequence repeats over and over again, row by row, quickly creating highly complex patterns from just those few rules. The animation below helps explain the rules and how the process unfolds.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590840292608-DPQNTCE84B8HNIXROIAQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNn6OV_RshlrquhzUbq-3otZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxFBKySwK360FWIRh3ndP-DuRy73LAqPTLb22-u4k1cCTFe6MLkD2qjY4jkNdLYTPY/One-d-cellular-automate-rule-30.gif\" data-image-dimensions=\"500x340\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"An animation of the way the rules of a 1D cellular automaton determine the next generation.  -  Cormullion  CC BY-SA 4.0\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee5468e27fc162ae107c0ad\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590840292608-DPQNTCE84B8HNIXROIAQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNn6OV_RshlrquhzUbq-3otZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxFBKySwK360FWIRh3ndP-DuRy73LAqPTLb22-u4k1cCTFe6MLkD2qjY4jkNdLYTPY/One-d-cellular-automate-rule-30.gif?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">An animation of the way the rules of a 1D cellular automaton determine the next generation. <br>- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#/media/File:One-d-cellular-automate-rule-30.gif\">Cormullion</a> CC BY-SA 4.0</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">There are a total of 256 possible rule combinations to create elementary cellular automata.

His process results in bold works with basket weave-like patterns that resemble graphic pixelated flags or banners. These works recall computing origins in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQzpLLhN0fY\">Jacquard loom</a>, a device that employed punch cards to simplify the intricate weaving process of eighteenth-century textiles. Golid explains his process:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">It's based on this traditional variant where pixels can be alive or dead on a 2D grid. I thought, ‘What if you don't change the rules, but instead, you change the visualization?’ Instead of using black and white pixels, I use lines that can go in different directions. While a 'standard' one-dimensional cellular automaton gets a pixel value from its three northern neighbors, this one is a hexagonal grid with lines in three directions. The existence of a specific line is dependent on the existence of its three 'preceding' lines. The lines split up the whole area into separate spaces, and I proceed to fill these spaces with colors. The colors are selected using a one-dimensional cellular automaton, with the color of each space being based on the left and upper neighboring spaces.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">It turned out quite nice. It seems so random, but it is actually based on strict rules. The only seed for this randomness is the number you give it. So whenever you give it the number 120, you get exactly the same output. But it seems so random because it turns so complex so fast. The noise part comes from another piece I made, more of a tool really, that can distort any image.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591668680665-7SDNOJBWKD9R4ZAZCHRX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLIj3bb_uLOihttx7hjsPSV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lqfkVpRp1g_2L-WsTQRP4IUeQvxhQLxDj0GQzUQT21mzi2feheXFTkax-QWHoTYtA/dual.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x3500\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Duel , Kjetil Golid\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee5468e27fc162ae107c0b9\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591668680665-7SDNOJBWKD9R4ZAZCHRX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLIj3bb_uLOihttx7hjsPSV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lqfkVpRp1g_2L-WsTQRP4IUeQvxhQLxDj0GQzUQT21mzi2feheXFTkax-QWHoTYtA/dual.jpeg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/print/kjetil-golid-2\"><em>Duel</em>, Kjetil Golid</a></p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">In graduate school, Golid developed a fascination for structures and systems such as Turing machines, regular language, and deduction systems, all of which were the focus of his <a href=\"http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/12644\">thesis</a>.

It started to separate into these cracks, and I just saw the whole algorithm right there. Okay, there that first crack formed and got wider, and then another crack came off of it. I wrote the algorithm right there in the coffee shop. The desert sun is pretty brutal.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">Tarbell was encouraged by his mother to make art in the home he grew in up quite a bit. However, his college studies focused on mathematics and computer science. He shared that while he viewed the world in a computational way, he wasn't afraid to express himself or try to find beauty in the computation.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Trying to understand and position ourselves within nature by understanding its algorithms and producing our own systems through the making of art can be a profoundly spiritual experience. I see Tarbell as a type of generative shaman unlocking new connections between us and the natural world around us -- and those connections are not always purely logical or fully explainable. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591669602273-L0LYLRY3NRYH63KTP8AC/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGS78un_bcNZLY1QrfTmegV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmCAYSV3hTiPxTEK49MCSWjAUExR1XJIzaGynRKcYSNjIURIYEjUUyXHl8441B9ptw/Screenshot-1654+%281%29.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1440x1440\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Shipibo Pattern  , Jared Tarbell\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee5468e27fc162ae107c0bf\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591669602273-L0LYLRY3NRYH63KTP8AC/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGS78un_bcNZLY1QrfTmegV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmCAYSV3hTiPxTEK49MCSWjAUExR1XJIzaGynRKcYSNjIURIYEjUUyXHl8441B9ptw/Screenshot-1654+%281%29.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><em>Shipibo Pattern </em>, Jared Tarbell</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">One of Tarbell's recent works, <em>Shipibo Pattern</em>, is inspired by the patterns seen by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipibo-Conibo_people\">Shipibo people</a>, an indigenous tribe that lives in the Amazon rainforest in Peru. The Shipibo believe that there are distinctive patterns that act as healing forces (or destructive forces). As Tarbell explains:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">During ceremony, a particular pattern is seen and heard by these people as a description of the reality of nature. I have seen it, too. The visual pattern is not what is actually witnessed, but an attempt to represent it in two dimensions. The patterns are composed of reflection, fractal self-similarity, and recursive motifs. Many of these constructions are native phenomena of computation. The Shipibo believe that the patterns are healing on emotional, physical, and spiritual levels. My personal experience with this vision leads me to believe it is an objective reality, one that can be modeled and explored.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591669917074-ZHE5C3U617OIJFRQT5BO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDxhhhwBddJ9fDxYAvV-2zp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lfYLKn_Tkl3ql2udpuE0YVV890f3o8Id5G8tJhHvhmC6z2Yvz7ttIxB3b9uYcWrOg/Screenshot-1539.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1047\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Shipibo Pattern,  Jared Tarbell\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee5468e27fc162ae107c0c2\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1591669917074-ZHE5C3U617OIJFRQT5BO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDxhhhwBddJ9fDxYAvV-2zp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lfYLKn_Tkl3ql2udpuE0YVV890f3o8Id5G8tJhHvhmC6z2Yvz7ttIxB3b9uYcWrOg/Screenshot-1539.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><em>Shipibo Pattern,</em> Jared Tarbell</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Tarbell shares the process he used to model this reality: </p><blockquote><p class=\"\">The background fuzz was generated with the common self-substituting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve\">Hilbert curve</a>.

Instead, emergence and decentralization point towards an unlimited number of simpler entities following basic rules which come together to yield spectacular results. However, understanding the power of emergence and being spiritual are not mutually exclusive. As Tarbell shared in our interview:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">I don't know if emergence describes everything. In fact, I kind of don't believe it does. I think there still are some very spiritual, mysterious elements to the universe.

We are both no longer active members of the church. However, we both grew up deeply invested in trying to live a spiritual life, and we both ultimately struggled to reconcile math, science, and logic with our religious upbringing. In some ways, I think this struggle has made us both seekers, ultimately leading us to the world of generative art. That strong desire to understand our place in the world and the connectivity between all that there is does not just go away when you stop going to church. For us, creating generative art and exploring emergence offers a spiritual path towards better understanding the&nbsp;“game of life” in which we all participate.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Some Final Thoughts</strong></p><p class=\"\">It's been a difficult year for people all around the world.

However, I developed a math phobia early on and never saw what, for many, is the obvious thread between the worlds of art, math, and nature. \nThat changed when I started to write code in graduate school and learned about three new topics within a few weeks of each other:\n\nGenerative art\n\nJohn Horton Conway’s Game of Life\n\nCellular automata and emergence   \n\nThese three interrelated discoveries completely changed my world view by showing me that much of the complexity we find in nature can be simulated and emulated using relatively basic algorithms.\nThis exhibition explores the idea of creating great complexity from deceptively simple algorithms or rule sets through the art of four generative artists: Alexander Reben, Manolo Gamboa Naon, Kjetil Golid, and Jared Tarbell. But before we jump into their art, let’s first define generative art, emergence, cellular automata, and the Game of Life. \nGenerative art is art that leverages a non-human, autonomous system which can help generate features in the artwork that would otherwise be left up to the artist to decide. In this exhibition, we are talking specifically about generative art written in computer code that includes elements of emergence or emergent behavior.  \nEmergence happens when two or more things come together to form something larger that has different properties than would be expected from the sum of the parts. Think of an ant colony. Each ant is pretty dumb, defenseless, and guided by very basic rules. But when combined with the many other ants in the colony, a new intelligence emerges at the colony level that allows them to adapt, defend themselves, and find food. The sophisticated emergent behavior of the colony cannot be predicted by understanding the limited capabilities of the individual ants. Flocks of birds and schools of fish operate in a similar manner, following a set of simple rules locally that result in complex behaviors globally. Emergence is not limited to our animal friends. Humans are a byproduct of emergent behavior, as is our economy, the weather, and traffic.  \nArtists, mathematicians, and computer scientists often generate their own complex emergent “ant colony-like” systems using a large grid of simple black and white squares called cellular automata. One of the most famous models of cellular automation is John Horton Conway’s Game of Life.\nJohn Conway playing the Game of Life in 1974.\nFirst published in the October, 1970 edition of Scientific American,  the game is comprised of a grid of cells that, based on a f...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5ee5468e27fc162ae107c0c7","isoDate":"2020-07-12T15:37:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"July 12, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"Jason Bailey","title":"FitArt - Fitness Art Club","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/6/13/fitart-fitness-art-club","pubDate":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:04:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Jason Bailey","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592055827082-LSW89I7YGYZHJYJBRS6O/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEVMsZtcNf6bC2DlE135eix7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UZSfoHNkRm7nrdAsNT0gXbdzCan2E3GUGjAPVUbZNFwtF-HWY8oCn8lZApDZXKlGig/0KQYDWgI.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2461x1641\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"0KQYDWgI.jpeg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee4d81376031e0b0e3de6f8\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592055827082-LSW89I7YGYZHJYJBRS6O/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEVMsZtcNf6bC2DlE135eix7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UZSfoHNkRm7nrdAsNT0gXbdzCan2E3GUGjAPVUbZNFwtF-HWY8oCn8lZApDZXKlGig/0KQYDWgI.jpeg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Have you always dreamed of having an artist’s physique?

Cortright's digitally-conceived artworks physically exist in many forms - printed onto archival surfaces, projected onto existing architecture, or mechanically carved from stone. A notable member of what became known as the 'Post Internet' art movement of the mid-to-late-2000s with her YouTube videos and online exhibitions, Cortright later began to laboriously craft digital paintings by creating layer upon layer of manipulated images in Photoshop which she then rendered onto materials such as aluminum, linen, paper, and acrylic sheets. In addition to her 2D work, in 2018 Cortright premiered a new body of sculptural work in marble. As with her paintings, Cortright's sculptures are intended to capture and represent a digital moment - in this case a digital brush stroke - that is translated into a three-dimensional object via industrial fabrication techniques. Cortright's role as an artist is an amalgam of painter, graphic designer, editor, and producer; culminating in a singular artistic reflection of contemporary visual culture that can exist on a smartphone screen, a Times Square billboard, and anything in between.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.petracortright.com/\">https://www.petracortright.com</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/petra_cortright/\">@petra_cortright</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592058107359-5D3HNHPL1O939E54T3QU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMtiXMEMZ8ID8MVhA-T_Qc9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIfy9uRsqnknGrsPwiW8VdnsJxMq6FvgYbxptNsO-6IOIKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/IMG_3187.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"750x750\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jeremy Bailey – Tassel Twirl (2020)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee4e0fbd0f44c604e17950b\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592058107359-5D3HNHPL1O939E54T3QU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMtiXMEMZ8ID8MVhA-T_Qc9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIfy9uRsqnknGrsPwiW8VdnsJxMq6FvgYbxptNsO-6IOIKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/IMG_3187.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jeremy Bailey – Tassel Twirl (2020)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<h2><strong>Jeremy Bailey –&nbsp;Tassel Twirl (2020)</strong></h2><p class=\"\">30 seconds video |&nbsp;no sound</p><p class=\"\">Cardio is more than just running on a treadmill!

At the center of his practice are playful interventions into found systems that explore the hidden – and often absurd – realities behind the glossy interfaces of our networked society. There the boundaries between human and software, individual and crowd, as well as labor and leisure are blurring. Schmieg works in a wide range of media such as video, website, installation, artist book, custom software and lecture performance.

Through videos, sculptures, online experiences, photography, performances, and installations, Mayer explores how technology affects our lives, bodies, and identities by processing how our physical world and bodies are impacted and reshaped by our participation in a digital landscape. Mayer investigates the points of tension between our online and physical worlds and makes work that attempts to inhabit the increasingly porous boundary between the two. Mayer's artwork has a consistent thread of modeling how to subvert capital-driven modes of technological innovation.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.jillianmayer.net\">https://www.jillianmayer.net</a></p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jillianmayer/\">@jillianmayer</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592059143065-2WVKGMIQDUY8OBIT4BNX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMtiXMEMZ8ID8MVhA-T_Qc9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIfy9uRsqnknGrsPwiW8VdnsJxMq6FvgYbxptNsO-6IOIKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/IMG_3202.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"750x750\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Molly Soda – Tap to Change (2020)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ee4e50717afcd5641b5257d\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1592059143065-2WVKGMIQDUY8OBIT4BNX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMtiXMEMZ8ID8MVhA-T_Qc9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIfy9uRsqnknGrsPwiW8VdnsJxMq6FvgYbxptNsO-6IOIKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/IMG_3202.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Molly Soda – Tap to Change (2020)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<h2><strong>Molly Soda – Tap to Change (2020)</strong></h2><p class=\"\">30 seconds video |&nbsp;no sound</p><p class=\"\">Tap the screen to change your appearance.

Our mobile touchscreens are perhaps our most intimate connection to the Internet, rarely leaving our sides. Here, two videos placed side by side, show everyday people performing everyday tasks on their mobile devices. Shot with an infrared camera, pixels ordinarily visible to the human eye become invisible, and those signals normally invisible are made visible. In obscuring the digital interface, the new and unnatural movements we have adopted become all the more apparent. By contrast, the only illumination visible from the phones is the ordinarily invisible infrared beam, emitted from LEDs in the top section of the phone near the earpiece and used primarily for facial recognition.

Cortright's digitally-conceived artworks physically exist in many forms - printed onto archival surfaces, projected onto existing architecture, or mechanically carved from stone. A notable member of what became known as the 'Post Internet' art movement of the mid-to-late-2000s with her YouTube videos and online exhibitions, Cortright later began to laboriously craft digital paintings by creating layer upon layer of manipulated images in Photoshop which she then rendered onto materials such as aluminum, linen, paper, and acrylic sheets. In addition to her 2D work, in 2018 Cortright premiered a new body of sculptural work in marble. As with her paintings, Cortright's sculptures are intended to capture and represent a digital moment - in this case a digital brush stroke - that is translated into a three-dimensional object via industrial fabrication techniques. Cortright's role as an artist is an amalgam of painter, graphic designer, editor, and producer; culminating in a singular artistic reflection of contemporary visual culture that can exist on a smartphone screen, a Times Square billboard, and anything in between.\nhttps://www.petracortright.com\n@petra_cortright\nJeremy Bailey – Tassel Twirl (2020)\nJeremy Bailey – Tassel Twirl (2020)\n30 seconds video | no sound\nCardio is more than just running on a treadmill!

Preying on financially strapped artists during a pandemic seemed like a new low, but clearly there must be a demand for this type of advice. So I decided to boil everything I have learned as an artist, curator, researcher, and marketer about obtaining success in the art world down into a single piece of free advice. <strong>If you want to succeed as an artist, make as much work as possible.</strong> That is the secret sauce. Regardless of whether you are after commercial success or simply want to improve in your craft, the answer is the same, make more work. If you want to know why I believe making more work improves your chances of success, read the rest of this post.</p><p class=\"\">There are few sins in my book worse than encouraging artists to produce less work. It’s like telling a fish not to swim or a bird not to fly. Yet this advice is often given by dealers and gallerists with good intentions who are trying to help artists “manage” their career and avoid “flooding their own market.” We’ll never know the amount of art that was not produced as a result of this bad advice. What a crime to rob humanity of more art simply to try and artificially inflate the market value of an artist’s work. In this post, I will argue there is no evidence that producing a high volume of work in any way damages an artists’ market. If anything, producing more work likely improves their chances at success.</p><p class=\"\">To study the effect of producing “too much work” on an artist’s market, we first need to establish “how much is too much?” The truth is that nobody knows the answer to this question. Five years ago, I went <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2017/9/1/artnome-featured-on-fivethirtyeight\"><span>in search of a single database</span></a> listing the total number of works created by our best-known artists. I reached out to a handful of Ivy league libraries as well as the Smithsonian, the Getty Institute, and other respected institutions asking for this database. They all came back to me with the same reply: “sadly no such resource exists.” So this leaves us all wondering, ‘How many artworks do successful artists create in a lifetime? A few dozen artworks? A few hundred artworks? A few thousand artworks? Low tens of thousands of artworks?’ The truth is, nobody knows because the resource to gauge this has never existed.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">So I decided to start the Artnome database and get my own numbers by scanning through printed catalogues raisonne (books containing the official count of works for each individual artist). The chart below shows the total number of works created by 32 well-known artists to give us a general idea of what a normal amount of work is for an artist to produce in their lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590964665378-X7XD6XSQ9KDHK8Y13BEX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKASjrhegF-wtkznmGLQD1J7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVuMrGw1kZ5V-0cInpKCehyMSO5hWQQj0hq2FlLSurNHJvwGh1qtNWvMhYKnvaKhbA/How_To_Become_A_Successful_Artist_Graph.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1790x1006\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"How_To_Become_A_Successful_Artist_Graph.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ed431b9f426f87f633f2d35\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590964665378-X7XD6XSQ9KDHK8Y13BEX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKASjrhegF-wtkznmGLQD1J7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVuMrGw1kZ5V-0cInpKCehyMSO5hWQQj0hq2FlLSurNHJvwGh1qtNWvMhYKnvaKhbA/How_To_Become_A_Successful_Artist_Graph.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Granted, this is not a perfect measure. For example Picasso’s Zervos catalogue contains 16,000 works but that number is <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/zervos-picasso-catalogue-reprinted-and-priced-at-20-thousand-dollars-2446/\">actually low</a> as there are many works that are not included. By some estimates Picasso left closer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/16/-sp-nightmare-picasso-museum-paris\">70,000 works</a> behind. Also, some catalogues raisonne include all works and others focus on one area such as paintings -- acknowledging the lack of absolute precision, what should immediately stand out is that Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol produced more than 10x the average amount of art produced by the other artists on the list. In fact a conservative estimate for Picasso, who lived to be 91, would suggest he created nearly one work every two days across an 80-year career. When <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Andy-Warhol-Catalogue-Raisonne-Vol/dp/0714840866\">Warhol</a> found he could not create fast enough, he famously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory\"><span>turned his studio into a factory</span></a> and employed others to make his work for him. If anyone would have damaged their market by over-producing, it must be Picasso and Warhol, right? Let’s take a look. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590962901870-YQ9O92HL5LS7R2TBDUN1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEahwwaK1bBrUhleg44Xyb8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dpj-lBXBevDa0zULNEOly1L4_NUtjXteWG1VE1dTPFjMCjLISwBs8eEdxAxTptZAUg/How_To_Become_A_Successful_Artist_Matrix.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2024x530\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Picasso’s and Warhol’s annual rank for turnover at auction vs all other artists.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ed42ad59654580ae7011430\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590962901870-YQ9O92HL5LS7R2TBDUN1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEahwwaK1bBrUhleg44Xyb8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dpj-lBXBevDa0zULNEOly1L4_NUtjXteWG1VE1dTPFjMCjLISwBs8eEdxAxTptZAUg/How_To_Become_A_Successful_Artist_Matrix.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Picasso’s and Warhol’s annual rank for turnover at auction vs all other artists.</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.artprice.com/\"><span>ArtPrice.com</span></a> puts out a report every year of the<a href=\"https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2019/ranking-of-the-top-500-artists-by-auction-turnover-in-2019\"><span> top 500 top-selling artists ranked by turnover at auction</span></a>.

Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Takashi Murakami, and KAWS all took Andy Warhol’s idea of hyper-production to the next level. While we don’t know the total number of works they will create in their lifetime, each of them has produced enough work to have sold <a href=\"https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2019/top-500-contemporary-artists/top-500-contemporary-artists-1-to-50/\"><span>over 100 works at auction in 2019</span></a> alone.

At least, we have yet to see an artist who has. Collectors who follow the art market closely might point to Damien Hirst. Hirst is thought by many to have <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-damien-hirsts-200-million-auction-symbol-pre-recession-decadence\"><span>flooded his own market in 2008</span></a> when he famously auctioned off 223 new works at Sotheby’s for $200.75M in 24 hours. Many argue this put a chill on Hirst’s market, but he had $26M in turnover in 2019 across 369 lots. I don’t think Hirst is suffering much.</p>&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590439297510-CCUQCR5I4INDLUKRQNEX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCXAmbIgMI78o84NhT6RhWwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dkqliSzw9PV_eXsXtMHfJ-3wGQ0-Rk33P7-x3gh5BgRvZtJ3qR9G2BYeA0wOAaeYNg/How-To-Become-A-Succesful-Artist-Hirst-Sothebys.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x998\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"From Hirst’s 2018 solo auction  Beautiful Inside my Head Forever  at Sotheby’s which net $200.75M in 24 hours\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ecc2d7f5699191ae983731f\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590439297510-CCUQCR5I4INDLUKRQNEX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCXAmbIgMI78o84NhT6RhWwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dkqliSzw9PV_eXsXtMHfJ-3wGQ0-Rk33P7-x3gh5BgRvZtJ3qR9G2BYeA0wOAaeYNg/How-To-Become-A-Succesful-Artist-Hirst-Sothebys.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">From Hirst’s 2018 solo auction <em>Beautiful Inside my Head Forever </em>at Sotheby’s which net $200.75M in 24 hours</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&nbsp;<p class=\"\">Still not convinced? After all, these are all examples of artists who have already made it. Surely there is some selection bias going on here, right? What about artists who just started out and have no market? Or up-and-coming artists just starting to build an audience who haven’t earned millions of dollars yet? Should they also make as much work as possible without worrying about flooding their markets? To find out, I asked the blockchain art market <a href=\"https://superrare.co/\"><span>SuperRare</span></a> to share data on 276 artists selling digital art on their platform.

Both artists started selling on SuperRare fairly early on and have built up a devoted collector base. As a measure of their success, they rank first and second respectively for total sales turnover (turnover in this case includes primary + secondary sales). Interestingly, their work may be “super,” but it is not particularly “rare” as compared to their peers. Both artists rank in the top 20 out of 276 artists for total works produced. So again it appears being a top producer does not limit your success, and may indeed contribute to it.

We know that paintings are generally worth more than prints and other multiples because only one collector can claim to own a painting, whereas many can own editions of the same print. My guess is that you could indeed flood your own market by over-producing the same print over and over again. However, there are also plenty of examples of artists benefiting from repeating the same image or visual theme as a way to establish their signature or brand. Think of Shepard Fairey’s OBEY Giant image stenciled on buildings all over the world or even the instant familiarity of the concentric color squares of Josef Albers or the sliced canvases of Lucio Fontana. This combination of frequency and consistency is the core of how visual branding works in marketing, and there is no reason to believe art collectors are immune to it. However, my point in this article is not that you should make one artwork and reproduce it ad nauseum. Rather, I am suggesting you produce as many new/unique works as you like without concern that making more work will somehow damage your chances of becoming a successful artist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590440215702-1U16D9H9ZVANUCCYXXG3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCmuuEjyfl1FYU8OpktyKwdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpyuxhp-yGlymYbaaugG_WLJ53s5GtFNsG4L792ChAz_9-KPda_Zlp_w1BC0rg37o4k/Albers.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"605x307\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Josef Albers,  Formulation Articulation I and II  - 1972\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ecc3117e8296a24e17e5a13\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590440215702-1U16D9H9ZVANUCCYXXG3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCmuuEjyfl1FYU8OpktyKwdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpyuxhp-yGlymYbaaugG_WLJ53s5GtFNsG4L792ChAz_9-KPda_Zlp_w1BC0rg37o4k/Albers.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/josef-albers-formulation-articulation-i-and-ii-11\">Josef Albers, <em>Formulation Articulation I and II</em> - 1972</a></p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Of course, success as an artist should not only be defined in terms of sales. Many artists are very successful and happy producing high quality work that they find fulfilling without ever giving much thought to selling at all. But if these artists are driven to improve at their craft over time, they too should seek to make as much work as possible. There is a famous and oft quoted passage in David Bayles and Ted Orland’s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733\"><span><em>Art &amp; Fear: Observations On the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking</em></span></a> which sums up the value of quantity over quality in artistic practice:</p><p class=\"\"><em>“The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.</em></p><p class=\"\"><em>His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.</em></p><p class=\"\"><em>Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: The works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”</em></p><p class=\"\">Sure, this is only one example, but it rings true for many creatives (myself included). Looking for more proof that practice makes perfect? Read Malcolm Gladwell’s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930\"><span><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em></span></a> which explores the habits of extremely creative and successful people. In the book, Gladwell spends a great deal of time on the “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule\"><span>10,000-Hour Rule</span></a>,” which posits expertise in any skill is a matter of focused practice for a great many hours combined with innate talent.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Maybe you are thinking, ‘I’ve put in my 10,000 hours and mastered my craft, so why can’t I sell my work?’ Unfortunately, excellence at your craft is only part of what is required for being successful on the art market — and likely not even the most significant part. I recently wrote an article for the Harvard Data Science Review titled “<a href=\"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/1vdc2z91/release/1\"><span>Can Machine Learning Predict the Price of Art at Auction?</span></a>” During my research, I was surprised to find that machine learning models designed specifically to look at the visual properties of art performed poorly in predicting value. Instead, the research suggests prestige, popularity, and access to the right network matter far more than any artistic skill or visual properties intrinsic to the artwork. Surprised? You shouldn’t be.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590440421209-AZ8QEY21UFGK8PHKY26I/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFfoeeKePfW2t65mF9AWPxEUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2-EDDAOHqMYoPf79n5caQZEzVjUxOVX5HAjuXZYjxxKahHAH51QaxKq4KdVMVBxpG/Forged_Rothko.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"754x1024\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Pei-Shen Qian painting in the style of Mark Rothko\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ecc31e45060ad27ee383dcc\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590440421209-AZ8QEY21UFGK8PHKY26I/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFfoeeKePfW2t65mF9AWPxEUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2-EDDAOHqMYoPf79n5caQZEzVjUxOVX5HAjuXZYjxxKahHAH51QaxKq4KdVMVBxpG/Forged_Rothko.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Pei-Shen Qian painting in the style of Mark Rothko</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&nbsp;<p class=\"\">Collectors regularly discover that a painting they thought to be by a famous artist -- say, <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/knoedler-rothko-in-forgery-show-1040315\">Mark Rothko</a> -- has turned out to be a forgery. When this happens, paintings once thought to be worth as much as tens of millions of dollars become virtually worthless overnight. Nothing has changed about the paint, the canvas, physical condition, color, content, composition, or general artistry behind the painting. The only difference is that the painting is no longer attributable to a popular and highly sought-after artist. This puts to rest the idea that the prices paid for bluechip art are driven by the skill of the artist and the virtues of the artwork alone.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">It may be depressing to realize that selling your art is largely a popularity contest. However, it can also be empowering once artists seeking to sell their work realize they have power and influence over their own success. In our digital world, artists are no longer as dependent on gatekeepers. They can and should play a role growing their own popularity and expanding their own network. Sure, you can try to accomplish this by schmoozing at all the important events, but when would you make art? Plus, a <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6416/825\">recent study</a> suggests if you are not born with the right connections in close proximity to prestigious institutions, your chances of success are slim. The good news is, by consistently producing a high volume of work and sharing it with the world through your social channels, you can grow your own popularity, network, and collector base. Think of your art as the fuel that drives interest in you as an artist. Stop creating art and the interest will dry up; produce an abundance of work and interest will intensify.</p><p class=\"\">Worried about bothering people by over-sharing your work through Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.? Remind yourself that Christie’s and Sotheby’s spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure we see paintings like Da Vinci’s <em>Salvator Mundi</em> and Hockney’s <em>Self-Portrait as an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)</em> as many times as possible leading up to their auction. They know we can’t afford to bid on paintings that sell for $100M or more. But by participating in the dialogue, we become complicit in their campaign to drive interest and value in the work. Why else would they promote these works so broadly when realistically, only a handful of collectors could afford to bid on them? The more people who see the works and the more often they see them, the more iconic and valued they become.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590440716533-U2WHH5UD9JUM7RHXT5QD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kALrjQvWPahEeVmx2bYAtWd7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYY6w5N8NzUotmeQxU111tZgO-ltwvBEP2bvzTaSFK8IxjuXoyzrtt4o1hWxZTq8Jw/davidhockneyb1937portraitofanartistpoolwithtwofigures19722400+%281%29.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2400x1682\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"David Hockney,  Portrait of an Artist ( Pool with Two Figures)  - 1972\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ecc3308b6e5372e0e352f66\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590440716533-U2WHH5UD9JUM7RHXT5QD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kALrjQvWPahEeVmx2bYAtWd7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYY6w5N8NzUotmeQxU111tZgO-ltwvBEP2bvzTaSFK8IxjuXoyzrtt4o1hWxZTq8Jw/davidhockneyb1937portraitofanartistpoolwithtwofigures19722400+%281%29.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/David-Hockney-Portrait-of-an-Artist-Pool-with-Two-Figures-9372-3.aspx\">David Hockney, <em>Portrait of an Artist ( Pool with Two Figures) </em>- 1972</a></p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&nbsp;<p class=\"\">Pay attention to how auction houses and top galleries <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/features/David-Hockney-Portrait-of-an-Artist-Pool-with-Two-Figures-9372-3.aspx\">advertise</a> works by top-selling artists.

Don’t simply flood your social feeds asking people to buy your art. Instead, try to raise the discourse by sharing works in progress, opening up about your process, and sharing the ideas behind your work. Worried about sounding too self-centered? Share work by other artists who inspire you in your feeds as well. There is a good chance they will reciprocate (though I’d encourage you to let that happen naturally).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">How do I know all this works? Because I am a painfully average and introverted guy who managed to break into the art world without even trying. In the last three years, I have been invited to speak at Christie’s and Sotheby’s, commissioned to write the cover story for <em>Art in America</em>, and curated art exhibitions and spoken at events around the world from the US and Europe to China and the Middle East. All of these opportunities and more came from my blog. It didn’t happen right away. I wrote for six months or so before anyone cared. But consistently putting out posts led to an amazing world of opportunity and a large audience of thoughtful, culturally aware, and engaged readers. Each time I put out a new article, another door opens. My world expands, making my life much richer. If it worked for me, I’m more than certain the same can be true for you. Go make your work, don’t worry about over-producing, share it in meaningful ways, and enjoy the ride! </p>\n\n\n\n  <form method=\"POST\" data-form-id=\"5ed4e8f0816525165b9b1e3b\" autocomplete=\"on\" onsubmit=\"return (function (form) {\n    Y.use('squarespace-form-submit', 'node', function usingFormSubmit(Y) {\n      (new Y.Squarespace.FormSubmit(form)).submit({\n        formId: '5ed4e8f0816525165b9b1e3b',\n        collectionId: '595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18',\n        objectName: 'item-5ecc1ea0ab61810adc160dff'\n      });\n    });\n    return false;\n  })(this);\" class=\"newsletter-form\">\n    <header class=\"newsletter-form-header\">\n      <h2 class=\"newsletter-form-header-title\">Artnome Newsletter</h2>\n      <p>Sign up with your email address to receive news and updates.</p>\n    </header>\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n              <fieldset id=\"name-yui_3_17_2_1_1591011519018_20021\" class=\"newsletter-form-name-fieldset form-item fields name required\">\n                \n                  <label class=\"newsletter-form-field-label title\">First Name</label>\n                  <input data-title=\"First\" spellcheck=\"false\" maxlength=\"30\" name=\"fname\" placeholder=\"First Name\" type=\"text\" class=\"newsletter-form-field-element field-element field-control\" x-autocompletetype=\"given-name\" />\n                \n                \n                  <label class=\"newsletter-form-field-label title\">Last Name</label>\n                  <input data-title=\"Last\" spellcheck=\"false\" maxlength=\"30\" name=\"lname\" placeholder=\"Last Name\" type=\"text\" class=\"newsletter-form-field-element field-element field-control\" x-autocompletetype=\"surname\" />\n                \n              </fieldset>\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              <label for=\"email-yui_3_17_2_1_1591011519018_20020-field\" class=\"newsletter-form-field-label title\">Email Address</label>\n              <input spellcheck=\"false\" name=\"email\" id=\"email-yui_3_17_2_1_1591011519018_20020-field\" placeholder=\"Email Address\" type=\"text\" class=\"newsletter-form-field-element field-element\" x-autocompletetype=\"email\" />\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        <button class=\"newsletter-form-button sqs-system-button sqs-editable-button-layout sqs-editable-button-style sqs-editable-button-shape\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign Up\"><span class=\"newsletter-form-spinner sqs-spin light large\"></span><span class=\"newsletter-form-button-label\">Sign Up</span><span class=\"newsletter-form-button-icon\"></span></button>\n      \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    <p>We respect your privacy.</p>\n    Thank you!\n    \n  </form>","contentSnippet":"Andy Warhol, Campbell’s Soup Cans - 1962\nLately I have seen a slew of ads for expensive classes promising to “help you become a successful artist.” These are marketing classes, not classes in art instruction. Preying on financially strapped artists during a pandemic seemed like a new low, but clearly there must be a demand for this type of advice. So I decided to boil everything I have learned as an artist, curator, researcher, and marketer about obtaining success in the art world down into a single piece of free advice. If you want to succeed as an artist, make as much work as possible. That is the secret sauce. Regardless of whether you are after commercial success or simply want to improve in your craft, the answer is the same, make more work. If you want to know why I believe making more work improves your chances of success, read the rest of this post.\nThere are few sins in my book worse than encouraging artists to produce less work. It’s like telling a fish not to swim or a bird not to fly. Yet this advice is often given by dealers and gallerists with good intentions who are trying to help artists “manage” their career and avoid “flooding their own market.” We’ll never know the amount of art that was not produced as a result of this bad advice. What a crime to rob humanity of more art simply to try and artificially inflate the market value of an artist’s work. In this post, I will argue there is no evidence that producing a high volume of work in any way damages an artists’ market. If anything, producing more work likely improves their chances at success.\nTo study the effect of producing “too much work” on an artist’s market, we first need to establish “how much is too much?” The truth is that nobody knows the answer to this question. Five years ago, I went in search of a single database listing the total number of works created by our best-known artists. I reached out to a handful of Ivy league libraries as well as the Smithsonian, the Getty Institute, and other respected institutions asking for this database. They all came back to me with the same reply: “sadly no such resource exists.” So this leaves us all wondering, ‘How many artworks do successful artists create in a lifetime? A few dozen artworks? A few hundred artworks? A few thousand artworks? Low tens of thousands of artworks?’ The truth is, nobody knows because the resource to gauge this has never existed. \nSo I decided to start the Artnome database and get my own numbers by scanning through printed catalogues raisonne (books containing the official count of works for each individual artist). The chart below shows the total number of works created by 32 well-known artists to give us a general idea of what a normal amount of work is for an artist to produce in their lifetime.\nGranted, this is not a perfect measure. For example Picasso’s Zervos catalogue contains 16,000 works but that number is actually low as there are many works that are not included. By some estimates Picasso le...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5ecc1ea0ab61810adc160dff","isoDate":"2020-06-01T19:38:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"June 1, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"Christina Cacouris","title":"Lumen Prize For Art and Tech With Founder Carla Rapoport","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/5/24/lumen-prize-for-art-and-tech-with-founder-carla-rapoport","pubDate":"Sun, 24 May 2020 21:18:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Christina Cacouris","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590268998533-DUX5F7BEIDOQM5QMZ6U4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFV9-UyvM8rLXJefQkV18z8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKc25jJrE_jxSNkV7Jc19PnjOqoYa-LZ3k_IpGFtV_4qUf5bFx1YqimGRBmAq4U73Bm/Melting-Memories-Lumen-Prize\" data-image-dimensions=\"1000x648\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Refik Anadol,  Melting Memories -  2019 Lumen Prize, Gold Award\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ec99446063db750f252a7d3\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590268998533-DUX5F7BEIDOQM5QMZ6U4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFV9-UyvM8rLXJefQkV18z8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKc25jJrE_jxSNkV7Jc19PnjOqoYa-LZ3k_IpGFtV_4qUf5bFx1YqimGRBmAq4U73Bm/Melting-Memories-Lumen-Prize?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><strong>Refik Anadol, <em>Melting Memories - </em>2019 Lumen Prize, Gold Award</strong></p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Luminaries of the art world have embraced it.

So why is digital art still undervalued?</p><p class=\"\">David Hockney, who started making still-life sketches on an iPad in the early 2010s that elicited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/16/david-hockney-landscapes\"><span>mixed reactions</span></a>, sells those prints for around $10,000 -- some more, some less -- compared to the cool $90.3 million that his <em>Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)</em> fetched at Christie’s in 2018. It was the highest price ever reached for a living artist (a record previously held by Jeff Koons). With this disparity between the two—the digital art being valued at approximately 0.01% of his master painting—it’s easy to surmise that digital art as a whole is valued less (financially, at least) than traditionally recognized forms of artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590269349979-1L3W4JU7ZQ127TIEW8Y0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOprhtRyFEOMIcbNui5Hx5JZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVGCUHqkJ0ZjT8-UHnDhz-bOyK6Och1bx1fDq5kad6GJ93ZSX5H8vzTHumOCpSC1Zjc/iPad-drawing-No-2-from-Da-001.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"460x613\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"David Hockney,  The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire  (iPad Drawing) - 2011\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ec995a5d02304239e9e7e59\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590269349979-1L3W4JU7ZQ127TIEW8Y0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOprhtRyFEOMIcbNui5Hx5JZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVGCUHqkJ0ZjT8-UHnDhz-bOyK6Och1bx1fDq5kad6GJ93ZSX5H8vzTHumOCpSC1Zjc/iPad-drawing-No-2-from-Da-001.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">David Hockney, <em>The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire</em> (iPad Drawing) - 2011</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">It shouldn’t be surprising: Photography, one of the newer mediums in art, is routinely valued at fractions of paintings and sculptures, though the prices are steadily climbing.

The current record for the highest amount paid for a photograph some 50 years later is $4.3 million.

In our new climate, where most galleries and museums are unclear on how and when they can reopen, digital art is proving itself to be a formidable avenue to fill the void that art-goers feel.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Carla Rapoport, founder of the <a href=\"https://lumenprize.com/the-prize/\"><span>Lumen Prize</span></a>, is helping bolster digital art in the contemporary art world. She created the prize in 2012 to support and encourage digital artists by giving them financial support (the prize fund is $11,500), as well as providing a network, helping to craft opportunities for these artists, linking them with museums, galleries, and brokering commissions. We spoke about the rise of digital art, how it’s collected, and what its future looks like in a world where smartphones are the new galleries.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>What prompted you to start the Lumen Prize in 2012, and what was the landscape like for digital art at that time?</strong></p><p class=\"\">I have a journalism background. I do not have an art background, which made me uniquely unqualified to launch an art prize <em>[laughs]</em>. However, it’s probably because I didn’t have any art qualifications that I was undaunted by the prospect of trying to shine a light on an aspect of art that I felt had been unfairly neglected at that time by the contemporary art world. I think it’s fair to say that now, it’s definitely been accepted, but back in 2012, it was only computer art. It was definitely niche. I went to see David Hockney’s show at the Royal Academy in 2012, “<a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/david-hockney-a-bigger-picture\"><span>A Bigger Picture</span></a>” -- I went four times. I kept being next to people saying, “How did he do this?” It was this incredible interest, and a really successful show. And I thought: ‘It couldn’t just be David Hockney who was doing this.’ And the more I looked into it, the more I discovered this goldmine of brilliant, creative, amazing art that wasn’t getting a fair shake at the contemporary art world. So I thought a prize would lift all boats. The first year we opened, we got amazing numbers of entries, and it’s just gone from there.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Do you remember any other artists you were seeing at that time, aside from Hockney, while researching that really stood out to you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590270371103-GIOY6C6IU728XBUII8R1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMqMLxfU071Sb97iuKpzHsgUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcxuPT4hGDireKSaO7nJufsLCFtiZWPBR6-xyKrs_ai3RqrskwyZsYRC8PjU8VMkn-/2a336f47-5d16-4d7a-8114-b293b2ccde42.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1000x615\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Yang Yongliang - From the New World (Detail)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ec999a23bbee218ed86c8ae\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590270371103-GIOY6C6IU728XBUII8R1/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMqMLxfU071Sb97iuKpzHsgUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcxuPT4hGDireKSaO7nJufsLCFtiZWPBR6-xyKrs_ai3RqrskwyZsYRC8PjU8VMkn-/2a336f47-5d16-4d7a-8114-b293b2ccde42.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Yang Yongliang - From the New World (Detail)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Yes. There’s a Chinese artist called <a href=\"https://www.yangyongliang.com/\"><span>Yang Yongliang</span></a>, who had a work collected by the British Museum. It was a stunning photo manipulation. His career has since gone skyrocketing. I was very intrigued with how contemporary Asian art was being affected; he had a huge influence on me other than David Hockney. And then when I went to the Tate, there were some moving image works and a lot of <a href=\"https://www.billviola.com/\"><span>Bill Viola</span></a>. He’s amazing, but there had to be more than Bill Viola. So I discovered people through the prize and then cottoned onto careers of amazing artists who’ve since qualified, and I’ve learned with the prize as it’s evolved.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>With someone like Hockney making iPad art, I understand he could make prints. But when it comes to something like video art, what exactly does that look like for collectors?</strong></p><p class=\"\">It’s been a question since the very first Lumen. Because the contemporary art world is not going to buy in until there’s a market -- or even a secondary market, really -- there needs to be someone who will buy it from you once you buy it. There’s lots of talk about stamping, authenticity, Bitcoin, all of that. In photography, you can destroy the negative. In print, you can destroy the plate. But in video art and in digital art, you have to have a pact with the artist who wants the scarcity value of the edition, and who you trust to give you a gigabyte file so you can play it on any technology that comes along. I don't know what technology my grandchildren will&nbsp;use to play the works I've collected in the years ahead. But there will be this huge 60 GB master file available for them to use, and that’s what the artist gave me. He keeps one, too. That’s what’s happening in video. And when you get into VR and other kinds of work, it becomes like sculpture, a thing that you own.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>I always wondered with video art, what would happen if someone were to post it online? But I guess it’s mutually beneficial to keep it private.</strong></p><p class=\"\">It would destroy the value of it. Why would you pay £10,000 for something and then destroy its value by putting it on YouTube? The artist has the same wish to keep the value high, as well. There’s now a collector base that’s becoming comfortable with this. You’re also seeing interior designers working with screen companies to make beautiful spaces for these videos to be seen in the home and enjoyed in the home.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>With the Lumen Prize, there’s a cash prize, but it also seems like once you’re in this group, you’re in a support network as well.</strong></p><p class=\"\">So in 2018, I set up <a href=\"https://lumenartprojects.com/\"><span>Lumen Art Projects</span></a>, a non-profit agency, and that became a home to support artists who qualified for the prize -- longlist, shortlist, or winner -- so that includes 60 artists every year. They become part of this network, and then through understanding their practice, we build opportunities for them. We’ve done commissions with all kinds of interesting partners, including the Barbican Centre and Public Space Art. We now have a partner with a museum in Norway, and they’re planning to reopen in June, which will feature Refik Anadol, last year’s winner. It’s very exciting. <em>[Ed. note: The Sørlandets Kunstmuseum re-opened in May 2020, and “</em><a href=\"https://lumenprize.com/event/re-memory-refik-anadol-sougwen-chung/\"><span><em>Re. Memory: Refik Anadol + Sougwen Chung</em></span></a><em>” opens June 18, 2020.]</em></p><p class=\"\"><strong>I’m looking forward to this year’s prize. Will it still be held in October?</strong><br><br>The call for entries is currently open. We’ve extended the deadline to the 12th of June, and we’ve also reduced the price of entry because of the COVID-19 situation. I hope anyone will consider entering if they make this kind of work or know people who make this kind of work. The awards ceremony will be the 22nd of October; we’re hoping that we’ll be able to hold it at the Barbican Center in London if events are happening again. If not, it will be held virtually, which will also be an exciting event.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>How many entries do you get each year?</strong></p><p class=\"\">We get about 700 works from about 500 artists each year. It’s been pretty steady over the years. We felt it was very white, and very western, so we launched an award called the Global South Award for artists who either work in or are from Africa, Latin America, or the developing economies of Asia and the Middle East. And we had a very good response from that. We also have a Nordic prize this year for artists in Scandinavian countries. We also have a free-to-enter student prize.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>That’s a really interesting point, that it’s primarily white people submitting. It makes sense thinking about people who would have access to technology and the know-how to be able to do this would, by default, already be in a more privileged position.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"\">Not necessarily! I don’t think that’s the barrier at all. Pretty much everyone has some sort of computer or tablet, or access to one. I don’t think getting access to the technology is hard at all. It’s gotten a lot cheaper. And they’re also growing a middle class in these countries, too, so the fact that we haven’t heard from any of them, I think, is really a lack of networks. That world isn’t really networked into the West as well as it could be. And we’d love to get kids from a disadvantaged situation entering -- young people, people in their 20s, who are in a very disadvantaged situation where we could have their voice on the table. The art world is pretty white; the contemporary art world is a pretty western, white world. I just want to diversify it as best I can, and broaden our networks.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>What percentage of people submitting do you think are creating digital art for the first time?</strong></p><p class=\"\">I think with still and moving images, it’s often newcomers. But with the rest of the categories, with interactive, AI, XR -- those are categories that you’ve probably been in for a while. Having said that, <a href=\"https://lumenprize.com/artwork/hyperplanes-of-simultaneity/\"><span>the winner in 2016</span></a> was an Italian oil painter who decided he wanted a VR aspect to his work; he found someone he could partner with and they created this work that won the Lumen Prize. And he was a first timer! He found the right partner, he had the right concept in his head -- he wanted to go into his picture and look down. Just vertigo. And it was mind-blowing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590270840050-SRXFM8PZJWRX31123PKM/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIHCUmLzp0hO7VG39MgL6Z0UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcuS6JIYxIxI5e5htG57IG3-EWuVL6hH0yqNWcXU9OSs_QtA7MN9ry4wo8UqOFJ8j9/hyper_palazzo-reale-Lumen-Prize.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1000x749\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Fabio Giampietro &amp;amp; Alessio De Vecchi,  Hyperplanes of Simultaneity -   2016 Lumen Prize, Gold Award\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ec99b782dd571390c33f5d9\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1590270840050-SRXFM8PZJWRX31123PKM/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIHCUmLzp0hO7VG39MgL6Z0UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcuS6JIYxIxI5e5htG57IG3-EWuVL6hH0yqNWcXU9OSs_QtA7MN9ry4wo8UqOFJ8j9/hyper_palazzo-reale-Lumen-Prize.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Fabio Giampietro &amp; Alessio De Vecchi, <em>Hyperplanes of Simultaneity - </em><strong>2016 Lumen Prize, Gold Award</strong></p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>It’s such a great entry point for people, if they win, to have that encouragement and go on continuing making art of that type.</strong></p><p class=\"\">Yes, and I think that the barriers to showing it and understanding it and enjoying it are falling all the time.

Collectors have embraced it. Auction houses have embraced it. So why is digital art still undervalued?\nDavid Hockney, who started making still-life sketches on an iPad in the early 2010s that elicited mixed reactions, sells those prints for around $10,000 -- some more, some less -- compared to the cool $90.3 million that his Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) fetched at Christie’s in 2018. It was the highest price ever reached for a living artist (a record previously held by Jeff Koons). With this disparity between the two—the digital art being valued at approximately 0.01% of his master painting—it’s easy to surmise that digital art as a whole is valued less (financially, at least) than traditionally recognized forms of artwork.\nDavid Hockney, The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate, East Yorkshire (iPad Drawing) - 2011\nIt shouldn’t be surprising: Photography, one of the newer mediums in art, is routinely valued at fractions of paintings and sculptures, though the prices are steadily climbing. In the late 1960s, The Museum of Modern Art purchased Eugene Atget’s photographic archive -- several thousand prints and many negatives -- for $80,000, which, at the time, was the highest price ever paid for a photographic collection. The current record for the highest amount paid for a photograph some 50 years later is $4.3 million. (Consider, again, Hockney’s Portrait of an Artist, which itself is dwarfed by the $450 million Leonardo da Vinci sold by Christie’s in 2018, the current record for the highest price ever paid for a work of art.) \nEugène Atget - Pont Neuf, 1923\nBut it’s doubtful that it will take 50 years for digital art to get its due the same way photography has. In our new climate, where most galleries and museums are unclear on how and when they can reopen, digital art is proving itself to be a formidable avenue to fill the void that art-goers feel. \nCarla Rapoport, founder of the Lumen Prize, is helping bolster digital art in the contemporary art world. She created the prize in 2012 to support and encourage digital artists by giving them financial support (the prize fund is $11,500), as well as providing a network, helping to craft opportunities for these artists, linking them with museums, galleries, and brokering commissions. We spoke about the rise of digital art, how it’s collected, and what its future looks like in a world where smartphones are the new galleries. \nWhat prompted you to start the Lumen Prize in 2012, and what was the landscape like for digital art at that time?\nI have a journalism background. I do not have an art background, which made me uniquely unqualified to launch an art prize [laughs]. However, it’s probably because I didn’t have any art qualifications that I was undaunted by the prospect of trying to shine a light on an aspect of art that I felt had been unfairly neglected at that time by the contempor...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5ec9931a9259ee3d458b6c9f","isoDate":"2020-05-24T21:18:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"May 25, 2020","image":""},{"title":"When frontend means full stack","link":"https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:00:00 GMT","content":"Reflections on the shifting responsibilities of frontend developers.","contentSnippet":"Reflections on the shifting responsibilities of frontend developers.","guid":"https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/","isoDate":"2020-05-21T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Increment","formattedDate":"May 21, 2020","image":""},{"title":"A user’s guide to CSS variables","link":"https://increment.com/frontend/a-users-guide-to-css-variables/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:00:00 GMT","content":"Long-requested but still underused, CSS custom properties for cascading variables offer revolutionary possibilities for collaboration and code reuse.","contentSnippet":"Long-requested but still underused, CSS custom properties for cascading variables offer revolutionary possibilities for collaboration and code reuse.","guid":"https://increment.com/frontend/a-users-guide-to-css-variables/","isoDate":"2020-05-21T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Increment","formattedDate":"May 21, 2020","image":""},{"title":"How to reevaluate your frontend architecture","link":"https://increment.com/frontend/how-to-reevaluate-your-frontend-architecture/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:00:00 GMT","content":"A process to break the chains of old, and usher in an age of less complexity, greater consensus, and a more functional technical stack.","contentSnippet":"A process to break the chains of old, and usher in an age of less complexity, greater consensus, and a more functional technical stack.","guid":"https://increment.com/frontend/how-to-reevaluate-your-frontend-architecture/","isoDate":"2020-05-21T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Increment","formattedDate":"May 21, 2020","image":""},{"title":"The process: Making Vue 3","link":"https://increment.com/frontend/making-vue-3/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:00:00 GMT","content":"Lessons from rewriting the next major version of Vue.js.","contentSnippet":"Lessons from rewriting the next major version of Vue.js.","guid":"https://increment.com/frontend/making-vue-3/","isoDate":"2020-05-21T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Increment","formattedDate":"May 21, 2020","image":""},{"title":"Micro-frontends in context","link":"https://increment.com/frontend/micro-frontends-in-context/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:00:00 GMT","content":"When—and why—should developers consider this newer, smaller frontend architecture pattern?","contentSnippet":"When—and why—should developers consider this newer, smaller frontend architecture pattern?","guid":"https://increment.com/frontend/micro-frontends-in-context/","isoDate":"2020-05-21T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Increment","formattedDate":"May 21, 2020","image":""},{"title":"A frontend stack for video games","link":"https://increment.com/frontend/a-frontend-stack-for-video-games/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:00:00 GMT","content":"Tales of a powerful and expressive game engine built entirely from open-source, web-based technologies.","contentSnippet":"Tales of a powerful and expressive game engine built entirely from open-source, web-based technologies.","guid":"https://increment.com/frontend/a-frontend-stack-for-video-games/","isoDate":"2020-05-21T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Increment","formattedDate":"May 21, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"Jason Bailey","title":"Original Art Or Digital Copy?

The survey results showed that participants found the images from augmented reality to be the most memorable after a week’s time.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">While interesting, the study raises more questions for me than it answers. For starters, I don't sit perfectly still when looking at art in a museum. I love to walk around, shifting from side to side, to see how paintings change. I enjoy exploring the dimensionality of the brushstrokes while zooming in and out of the canvas. In the conclusion of the paper, Dr. Sinha acknowledges, \"Movement would create a stronger facsimile of a true museum experience…\" and could be included in future testing.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">I also wonder if the test results would have skewed towards a greater appreciation for the original paintings if, instead of screening for a lack of art experience, they instead screened to optimize for expertise in art. As an art historian, knowing I am standing in front of the same canvas labored upon by the artist is very meaningful to me and adds to the experience. For example, I grew up only seeing Rothko paintings reproduced in books. I thought his work was stupid and assumed people only claimed to like it due to peer pressure. Then I saw a great number of his paintings in person at a retrospective, and I had the closest thing I’ve ever had to a religious experience. Being enveloped by those giant canvases one after the other was life changing -- an experience I refuse to believe could be reproduced on a tablet using AR and an experience that I know firsthand was not able to be reproduced in printed books.</p><p class=\"\">As an artist, I know that we take great care in managing how and where people view the work we create down to the tiniest decisions over materials choices. We lose sleep over details like surface texture and lighting.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">As a curator, I have had hours-long conversations about what kind of tablet or screen an artist is willing to use, because even the smallest details alter the experience for the viewer. Every artist I’ve ever worked with would tell you they care deeply about whether their work is shown on canvas, a digital screen, or displayed using VR or AR.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1589887739384-G5ESXP1WCP86FZJZ14E5/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMdZW8fF-4YSUoN6R4423jl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmp4xLnmBXZbE9LnusaJmlM1O_0YqvNI2kDnxSDDoDoHmwrKIzOKbz70OhOUenjDw5/Screen+Shot+2020-05-19+at+7.25.42+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1394x1056\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Cuseum\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5ec3c2f72c8fb612b87ddab8\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1589887739384-G5ESXP1WCP86FZJZ14E5/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMdZW8fF-4YSUoN6R4423jl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmp4xLnmBXZbE9LnusaJmlM1O_0YqvNI2kDnxSDDoDoHmwrKIzOKbz70OhOUenjDw5/Screen+Shot+2020-05-19+at+7.25.42+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Photo courtesy of Cuseum</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">When I first discovered Starbucks was going to shut down for COVID, I bought a half-dozen bags of their beans, a grinder, and a French press to make coffee for myself at home.

I still drank the coffee at home because it was the best I could get.

It did, however, make me realize I have two major addictions: art museums and Starbucks. Luckily, my neighborhood Starbucks just reopened, and my good friend Brendan Ciecko and his team at Cuseum are trying to give me my museums back, but with a twist.\nCuseum has announced the launch of a new app enabling art lovers to view works from their favorite museums on the walls of their homes using AR (augmented reality). I know what you are thinking: “It's just not the same as going to a real museum.” \nBut new research by MIT professor Dr. Pawan Sinha indicates otherwise. Dr. Sinha's paper titled \"Neurological Perceptions of Art through Augmented & Virtual Reality,\" published by Cuseum, suggests that \"the human brain doesn't differentiate between digitally reproduced artworks and their originals.\" This immediately felt wrong to me, so I decided to read the paper to see if I could better understand the findings from their research.\nAccording to the paper, their experiment included nine test participants. The participants were screened to find subjects with little to no background in art who had limited exposure to AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality). All testing was conducted at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts (my go-to museum). Participants were shown artworks through four different environments:\n\nAugmented reality (AR)\n\nVirtual reality (VR)\n\nTwo-dimensional photographic reproduction\n\nAuthentic original\n\nAdditionally, the participants were tested while staring at a blank wall of the museum to establish a baseline phase. \nThe paper explains that the test uses EEG (electroencephalography) to evaluate the electrical activity in the brains of participants in an attempt at \"measuring non-conscious engagement.\" You have likely seen images of people with electrodes on their scalp and a whole bunch of wires coming off of their heads on TV or in movies.

By the standards of the $67.4B-a-year art market (McAndrew, 2019), this may have been a bargain.</p><p class=\"\">In the last 3 years, the seemingly unpredictable world of blue chip art auctions has caught the attention of the public and the mainstream media. Upon selling for $1.4M at Sotheby's, Banksy's painting <em>Girl With a Balloon</em> proceeded to shred itself in the auction house through a mechanism hidden in its frame. The public naturally assumed the damage from the shredding made the painting worthless. On the contrary, several Banksy experts believe the notoriety from the stunt likely doubled its value and will raise the prices of all Banksy works (Calfas, 2018; Reyburn, 2018).</p><p class=\"\">In 2019, Jeff Koons's stainless steel sculpture <em>Rabbit</em>, modeled after a cheap inflatable toy bunny, fetched $91M, setting a new record for most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction (Wamsley, 2019). And in 2017, the record for most expensive work by any artist was broken when a heavily restored painting thought to be by Leonardo Da Vinci sold for a whopping $450M. The very same painting had sold for $10,000 just twelve years earlier in 2005 (Greene, 2017).</p><p class=\"\">These sales regularly make global headlines because the prices seem to defy human logic. But what about machine logic? Are there specific qualities consistent across artworks and artists that can be detected, broken down, and analyzed by human experts or machine learning models to predict the value of art at auction accurately? Or could the prices paid for art simply fall outside the realm of prediction?</p><h1>Human Appraisal of Art&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1><p class=\"\">On the surface, the art market, built on the fickle tastes of individual collectors, would appear to be particularly unpredictable. Impressionism may be in vogue today and out of style tomorrow. Entire markets can seemingly shift overnight based on the whims of a handful of influential collectors. Unlike fungible stocks that trade in high volume, each artwork is unique and different from the next, and works can go decades between sales, making it difficult to establish any logical pattern or change in value (Mei &amp; Moses, 2002).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In describing the art market, Plattner (1998) characterized it as having two unusual qualities. First, people spend enormous sums of money on objects that are nearly impossible to value. Second, given the limited number of potential buyers, it is difficult for artists to know if there will be any demand for the work they are creating. These challenges have led some economists to caution would-be art investors against fooling themselves into believing they could somehow turn a profit in a market where prices \"float around aimlessly\" with the randomness of a dice game (Baumol, 1986).</p><p class=\"\">Regardless of what skeptics might think about the feasibility of price prediction, professional art appraisers must develop a presale price estimate for each artwork that goes to auction. Trained in particular genres and geographical markets, appraisers take into consideration many important factors, including the artist, country of origin, age of the artwork, dimensions, rarity, signature, materials, subject, and condition. The appraiser then looks for similar items recently sold at auction and considers the current market demand. Finally, they develop both a low estimate and a high estimate, creating a range of values within which they believe the work could reasonably sell.</p><p class=\"\">Based on the past performance of art appraisers employed at the two largest auction houses, Christie’s and Sotheby’s, art prices would appear to be somewhat predictable. Actual prices fell between the appraiser’s high and low estimate for Christie's 41% of the time and within range for Sotheby's 37% of the time in a study by Bjerg (2018) looking at 195,479 sales from 2016 and 2017.</p><p class=\"\">It would appear that art appraisal is a valuable skill that improves over time. For example, auction houses with more experience in selling work by a given artist not only produced more accurate presale estimates, but they also had a higher likelihood of completing a sale, according to Bruno et al. (2016). One reason for this might be that auction houses with experience selling works by a particular artist have developed personal relationships with the collectors of that artist's work and, therefore, better understand the demand in the market.</p><p class=\"\">There is also strong evidence that appraisals act as anchors in influencing the price that collectors are willing to pay for a work at auction. Appraisers themselves are not immune to the effects of anchoring to past estimates when constructing new appraisals for works returning to market (Beggs &amp; Graddy, 2009).</p><p class=\"\">But is appraisal an art form, relying on a combination of human relationships, soft skills, insider industry knowledge, and human bias, or is it science with discrete steps that can be replicated and mastered by a machine learning model?</p><h1>Machine Learning Appraisal of Art</h1><p class=\"\">One might assume that the sale price of artwork at auction would depend heavily on its visual features. After all, that is what we do with art—we look at it. So it makes sense that when trying to predict the value of art using machine learning, most data scientists start with visual analysis. Convolutional neural networks are specifically designed for this type of research and are a popular choice. But surprisingly, researchers have found convolutional neural networks do a poor job in predicting the price of art at auction on their own. Models based on numeric and textual data perform far better than those looking only at images (Aubrey et al., 2019; Ayub et al., 2017). The implication is that what art looks like is not as important as one might think in determining how much it will sell for at auction. At least not to machine learning. However, companies like Art Recognition have been using computer vision and machine learning to authenticate which artist created a given work of art.&nbsp; This authentication can have enormous impact on its value at auction.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">How could it be that the visual properties of art are not that important in establishing its value at auction? After all, shouldn't the inherent qualities of an artwork—its craftsmanship, its aesthetics, and its ability to resonate with viewers—be primary drivers of its price? We know this is not the case. Artworks discovered to be forgeries or misattributed can drop in value from hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to almost worthless in a heartbeat despite nothing physically changing about the work. This rapid depreciation would imply that art’s value at auction derives almost entirely from the artist's reputation and has little to do with the artwork itself. One might then assume that an artist earns their notoriety based mostly on their artistic skills. Yet, new evidence suggests reputation may have much to do with early access to prestigious galleries and museums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">To better understand how access to prestigious institutions impacts artists' reputation and valuation, Fraiberger et al. (2018) mapped out the careers of 496,354 artists, looking at their exhibitions and sales. They placed the artists in the study into two groups based on the prestige of the institutions where they held their first five exhibitions. The results suggest that access to prestigious institutions had an enormous effect on an artist's career trajectory and played a significant role in predicting the sale price of their work.</p><p class=\"\">Artists with early access to high-prestige institutions had twice as many exhibitions as low-prestige artists. High-prestige artists' work was traded 4.7 times more often at auction and at a maximum price that was 5.2 times higher than for low-prestige artists. The team then collected 442,314 prices of artworks displayed in galleries and found the average maximum price for high-prestige artists was $193,064 versus $40,476 for low-prestige artists.</p><p class=\"\">Disappointingly, the findings also suggested that artists born into countries without access to high-prestige institutions tended to stay low prestige throughout their careers. One might attribute this to selection bias, implying the most prestigious institutions selected the most talented artists. However, it is unlikely that one's artistic talent correlates with the country or region in which they are born. Yet artists born in countries with little or no access to high-prestige institutions consistently struggled, most often starting and finishing their careers as low-prestige artists.</p><p class=\"\">Given these findings, it appears important to mine the textual data describing artists and artworks for signals of reputation and prestige in addition to performing a visual analysis of the art. Though not as accurate as human appraisals, a machine learning model performed well when trained on textual and numeric data, including artist, year of creation, materials, and size, by Aubry et al. (2019). Their machine learning model was significantly more accurate in predicting prices of art at auction than a hedonic regression model trained on the same data. This improvement is likely due to machine learning's strength in analyzing not only the training features but also the complex relationships between those features. For example, understanding the dynamics between artist, color, and dimensions, and their impact on pricing can be challenging to capture with hedonic regression.&nbsp; The machine learning model was also resistant to a systematic bias found in human appraisers who failed to sufficiently reduce their estimates in response to negative information about decreasing sale prices in artists’ markets.</p><p class=\"\">A second way to potentially automate the capturing of artists' reputation and prestige would be to perform text analysis on their biographies and evaluate their social media presence.&nbsp; Powell et al. (2019) used text analysis to examine how artists sold their work through sites like Saatchiart.com and ArtFinder.com. The team analyzed descriptions of artworks and artists' biographical information using popular machine learning techniques including k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forest classifiers to see if word count was indicative of sale price. They selected the random forest model as the base for testing of additional features as it performed the best out of the initial group. In the testing, word count from the description of the artwork had an impact, but the best results came from a combination of artwork description word count and artist biography word count. They also tested to see if the presence of social media accounts impacted prices. Interestingly, links to social media accounts had no real impact on their own, but when combined with word count, they showed to have some influence on sale price.&nbsp; One explanation for this is that social media could primarily be a measure of an artist’s marketing savvy, which may already be accounted for in the word count of their biography and artwork descriptions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h1>Expanding the Art Market Through Automated Valuation</h1><p class=\"\">Manual appraisal of art is slow, expensive, and limited by the number of human experts available. While not as accurate, machine learning can dramatically increase the volume, speed, and frequency of appraisals. Instead of only estimating prices for art headed to auction, all artworks, on and off the market, could regularly undergo automated valuation using machine learning. This approach is already in use in the real estate market with companies like Zillow, Redfin, and Trulia.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Public pricing estimates for all artwork and not just art headed to auction could help grow the art market. Economists generally agree that increased transparency leads to increased liquidity in markets (Lang &amp; Maffett, 2011; Pagano &amp; Röell, 1996). While some market participants may not want greater transparency because they benefit from an inefficient system, there is evidence that the lack of publicly available pricing is the number one deterrent to collectors buying more art (Artsy, 2019).</p><p class=\"\">Various automated appraisal systems have been around for close to a decade, but have enjoyed limited success.&nbsp; Currently, at least one major auction house, Sotheby's, is seeking to improve the use of machine learning for appraisal automation to help drive liquidity (A. Qamar &amp; A. Shum, personal communication, October 24, 2019). Ahmed Qamar, VP director of machine learning, and Andrew Shum, VP director of product, lead Sotheby's machine learning team. According to Qamar and Shum, their team has two goals: making selling easier and driving business impact. Shum shared that Sotheby's sells over 50,000 lots annually, and each lot is currently getting a human-generated price estimate. Since the number of lots sold at Sotheby's is presently limited by how fast human experts can produce estimates, automating even a small piece of the manual process can drive up efficiency and have a significant impact on the business. To accomplish this, they are working on augmenting human appraisers' abilities to identify comparable works with machine vision and machine learning.</p><p class=\"\">Shum explained that Sotheby's goal is not to replace human appraisers with machine learning, but instead to make them \"super predictors.\" They hope to free appraisers from menial and repetitive tasks so they can focus more on the higher end of the market where the volume is lower and the accuracy of estimates becomes more critical due to higher dollar-value items.</p><p class=\"\">For middle-market appraisals, Qamar wants to remove manual processes altogether and fully automate not only price estimation, but the entire end-to-end sales process. Qamar would also like to automatically generate up-to-date appraisals for every work that Sotheby's has ever sold. He hopes this might highlight works that offer surprisingly high returns, which Sotheby's can then take to the owners, encouraging them to sell at a profit. If the owners agree to sell, Sotheby's can also use their recommendation engine created by Shum and Qamar to automatically advertise those works to Sotheby's massive client database based on past buying patterns. The strategy is essentially to automate the construction of bidding wars to achieve the highest possible sale price for the seller.</p><p class=\"\">As Shum explained it, in examining which features drive up the price of artworks at auction, the number of bidders was second only to the artist who created the work—and according to Shum, Sotheby's recommendation engine would enable them to influence the number of bidders heavily. With these machine learning–driven capabilities, not only could Sotheby's estimate prices—they could influence them, achieving optimal returns for their clients at auction.&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p class=\"\">Many researchers have expressed beliefs that prices for art are perhaps unpredictable. Yet, there is a practical need to create presale estimates for all work sold at auction. Humans are currently more accurate than machines in crafting these estimates. However, machine learning models can potentially scale to appraise all art, not just the work going to auction at any given time. Automated pricing of all artworks on and off the market could drive up liquidity by providing additional information to buyers. To this end, Sotheby's has been exploring machine learning to price all past lots and to develop an automated end-to-end sales process.</p><p class=\"\">Although economists might have advised against it, purchasing the duct tape banana may have been a good investment. The research suggests that extrinsic features like artists’ reputation and the number of bidders are more important than features unique to the artwork. Cattelan's stunt has no doubt increased his global reputation, which should drive up the value of the work. And if the current owners wait just a few more years before selling, Sotheby's automated sales process might even trigger a bananas bidding war to assure the best possible return.</p><p class=\"\"><br></p><h1>References</h1><p class=\"\">Artsy.

By the standards of the $67.4B-a-year art market (McAndrew, 2019), this may have been a bargain.\nIn the last 3 years, the seemingly unpredictable world of blue chip art auctions has caught the attention of the public and the mainstream media. Upon selling for $1.4M at Sotheby's, Banksy's painting Girl With a Balloon proceeded to shred itself in the auction house through a mechanism hidden in its frame. The public naturally assumed the damage from the shredding made the painting worthless. On the contrary, several Banksy experts believe the notoriety from the stunt likely doubled its value and will raise the prices of all Banksy works (Calfas, 2018; Reyburn, 2018).\nIn 2019, Jeff Koons's stainless steel sculpture Rabbit, modeled after a cheap inflatable toy bunny, fetched $91M, setting a new record for most expensive work by a living artist sold at auction (Wamsley, 2019). And in 2017, the record for most expensive work by any artist was broken when a heavily restored painting thought to be by Leonardo Da Vinci sold for a whopping $450M. The very same painting had sold for $10,000 just twelve years earlier in 2005 (Greene, 2017).\nThese sales regularly make global headlines because the prices seem to defy human logic. But what about machine logic? Are there specific qualities consistent across artworks and artists that can be detected, broken down, and analyzed by human experts or machine learning models to predict the value of art at auction accurately? Or could the prices paid for art simply fall outside the realm of prediction?\nHuman Appraisal of Art   \nOn the surface, the art market, built on the fickle tastes of individual collectors, would appear to be particularly unpredictable. Impressionism may be in vogue today and out of style tomorrow. Entire markets can seemingly shift overnight based on the whims of a handful of influential collectors. Unlike fungible stocks that trade in high volume, each artwork is unique and different from the next, and works can go decades between sales, making it difficult to establish any logical pattern or change in value (Mei & Moses, 2002).  \nIn describing the art market, Plattner (1998) characterized it as having two unusual qualities. First, people spend enormous sums of money on objects that are nearly impossible to value. Second, given the limited number of potential buyers, it is difficult for artists to know if there will be any demand for the work they are creating. These challenges have led some economists to caution would-be art investors against fooling themselves i...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5eb17a8baf692776cd25471a","isoDate":"2020-05-05T14:52:57.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"May 5, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"Jason Bailey","title":"2020 Art Market Predictions","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/1/27/2020-art-market-predictions","pubDate":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:25:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Jason Bailey","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578914901141-ICDG9MR6STA4EEXXJOAC/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNLR0kaSaPDXxtmQ1J8HckYUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcsB7Di66H4v3Oh5eEljzZOsjQ45JIrAcvRmjoJbLrK-ymPL1veL4eqF2zLIT2J1nn/QmYMXMqhxBFnPftsbEVo6de9idfijq1DtWe1aRVa4bjbtX.gif\" data-image-dimensions=\"1200x927\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Osinachi  - Elephant in the Room , 2019\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e1fad8a4293956c31a55023\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578914901141-ICDG9MR6STA4EEXXJOAC/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNLR0kaSaPDXxtmQ1J8HckYUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcsB7Di66H4v3Oh5eEljzZOsjQ45JIrAcvRmjoJbLrK-ymPL1veL4eqF2zLIT2J1nn/QmYMXMqhxBFnPftsbEVo6de9idfijq1DtWe1aRVa4bjbtX.gif?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Osinachi<em> - Elephant in the Room</em>, 2019</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">We are in the middle of a generational culture war, and the entire art market is about to be turned upside down by an emerging class of collectors looking to reshape the art world in their own image.</p><p class=\"\">As we enter a new decade, my 2020 art market predictions will make the case that the art market will be unrecognizable ten years from now (in 2030).

They've even popularized the catch phrase \"OK Boomer\" to efficiently dismiss a generation whose values they see as closed-minded and incompatible with their own. Likewise, Boomers frequently refer to Millennials/Gen-Zers as the \"Snowflake Generation\" for believing that they are each unique and special, seeking too much attention, and being over-emotional and sensitive.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">How big is the gap in values between generations, and where do they differ?

Trump's best-known mantras are \"your fired\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/trump-us-building-wall-colorado/index.html\">build a wall</a>.\" Both are messages of exclusivity and subjugation designed to bully and humiliate those in less powerful positions. Trump's persona is a caricature of the 1980s playboy built on public displays of extravagance and wealth. His attitudes towards women inspired <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/womens-march-protest-count/514166/\">the largest single-day protest march in US history</a> just one day after his inauguration. Trump's administration has not been friendly to <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/tap/donald-trump\">LGBTQ rights</a>. And finally, Trump is anti-science and does not agree with experts about <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/\">climate change</a>, calling it a <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/\">Chinese hoax</a>. </p><p class=\"\">Obviously, Trump embodies some firmly held Boomer ideas about leadership, or else the majority of them wouldn't have elected him as their president.

As the next generation of collectors scour history to find artists who gave us early warnings that we needed to take better care of our planet and the people who inhabit it, Denes' name will regularly show up at the top of the list of those few who did.</p><p class=\"\">In addition to their concerns over climate change, Millenials/Gen-Zers are also the most technologically fluent generation we have seen. Given their interest and comfort with tech, I believe that the market for <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art\">generative art</a> — art generally created in code using autonomous, automated systems -- will explode in the next two decades. As one of the only early generative art pioneers to come to computers in the 1960s with decades of experience as a working artist, I believe Vera Molnar is perhaps the most important generative artist of all time.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1579828461466-14QMIQIM2HRWKIR7NV77/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEMCAj14_ZsyKS2MZhZV2IdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIfxbLUSWJsui_kAx3nTzZMwlWFlpqRN18RgkhenZowWgKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/vera_molnar_showing_off.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"960x679\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Vera Molnar\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e2a44eddb08282f9a938151\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1579828461466-14QMIQIM2HRWKIR7NV77/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEMCAj14_ZsyKS2MZhZV2IdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIfxbLUSWJsui_kAx3nTzZMwlWFlpqRN18RgkhenZowWgKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/vera_molnar_showing_off.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Vera Molnar</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">At the age of 96, Vera Molnar has now created cutting-edge art that explore algorithms with and without computers across eight decades. Molnar helped bridge the gap between computers, which were thought to be cold and antagonistic to human creativity, and traditional artistic practice.

I see collecting as an act that can be just as creative as making art or curating an exhibition.

Based on the extreme shift in values and the ensuing wealth transfer, I predict that by 2030:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\">Works by five non-white and or non-male artists will sell for more than $50M each</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Women move from 2% of sales at auction to at least 10%</p></li><li><p class=\"\"> Women shift from 11% of all work acquired for permanent collections to at least 25%</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Women will go from being featured in just 14% of exhibitions to 30%</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Acquisitions of art by African-Americans by major US museums will go from 2.3% to 10%</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Art in US museums will go from 2.5% by Latino Artists to 5%</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">In summary, art’s price is built around popularity. What was popular with the Boomers is mostly unpopular with Millenials and Gen-Zers. Specifically, these younger generations are more interested in diversity, more concerned with climate change, and more comfortable with technology. We should expect that artists propped up by Boomer wealth may have a hard time finding buyers in ten or twenty years — specifically, artists who sexualized or objectified women or treated animals or the environment poorly. By contrast, many talented female artists and artists of color will see their work increase in value -- not because of their gender or skin color,  but because they have always been great and only needed a more open-minded generation to be fully recognized for their talents.  </p>","contentSnippet":"Osinachi - Elephant in the Room, 2019\nWe are in the middle of a generational culture war, and the entire art market is about to be turned upside down by an emerging class of collectors looking to reshape the art world in their own image.\nAs we enter a new decade, my 2020 art market predictions will make the case that the art market will be unrecognizable ten years from now (in 2030). I build this case on three core beliefs that I will outline and argue in this article:\n\nArtist popularity is more important in driving the price of artworks than any qualities intrinsic to the art\n\nMillennials/Gen-Zers are culturally antithetical to Boomers\n\nBoomer wealth will change hands over the next two decades and Millenials/Gen-Zers will use it to invest in diversity in the arts\n\nI've spent the last three months researching the literature on price prediction and valuation for the art market for an article I submitted to an academic journal. I won't re-write that article here, but I will share that I came away believing we are about to see a massive shift in which artists are propped up by the art market.  Here's why:\nArt Prices are Largely a Popularity Contest\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          \n            \nA Mark Rothko forgery that turned out to be by Pei-Shen Qian\nIn 2004, Domenico De Sole, former CEO of Gucci and current chairman of Sotheby's, paid $8.3M to the Knoedler & Co. gallery for a painting thought to be by Mark Rothko. The work was one of many painted by art forger Pei-Shen Qian and sold through the gallery to unsuspecting collectors. De Sole sued the Knoedler gallery in 2016 for $25M in damages. When asked if the knowledge that the painting was no longer by Mark Rothko changed its value, De Sole exclaimed, \"I think so!\" adding, \"It's worthless.\"\nNothing physically changed about the painting — it had the same appearance and the same craftsmanship and quality. Yet it went from being worth millions of dollars to worthless when discovered to be by Pei-Shen Qian instead of Mark Rothko. This extreme devaluation of works discovered to be forgeries happens all the time. Why? Because the popularity of an artist is more important than any qualities having to do with the artwork itself in establishing its price. Mark Rothko is more popular than Pei-Shen Qian, so his work is more expensive.\nWe’d like to think an artist’s popularity and success is tied to their talent and skill. History shows that gender, skin color, and according to one recent study, where you were born and the level of access you have to a handful of prestigious institutions, are the most important factors in developing a successful career as an artist. Talent-wise, you might be the next Mark Rothko, but if you are not popular with the right group of people, you might as well be Pei-Shen Qian.  \nThis dependency on arti...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5e1fad8a4293956c31a55031","isoDate":"2020-01-28T00:25:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"January 28, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"Jason Bailey","title":"Artnome - 2019 Year in Review","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/1/11/artnome-2019-year-in-review","pubDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 10:02:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Jason Bailey","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578850508177-2WWA53HHAFCNI1A4YV1M/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kE1_y_SjPLhltNNEkgF8MmN7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmQ0LVhdSDfDO_dRtz6dxReiFR1uvyIoNcAP9jhDHWwARme-dEvH06fX7BVPEzezwU/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+12.27.04+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1316x1318\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Podmork Portrait of Jason Bailey  by Hackatao, 2019\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e1b58c812be5b2164d04c8b\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578850508177-2WWA53HHAFCNI1A4YV1M/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kE1_y_SjPLhltNNEkgF8MmN7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmQ0LVhdSDfDO_dRtz6dxReiFR1uvyIoNcAP9jhDHWwARme-dEvH06fX7BVPEzezwU/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+12.27.04+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><em>Podmork Portrait of Jason Bailey</em> by Hackatao, 2019</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">What a year for Artnome!

Leaving a fantastic job with a great team and with no idea how I would make money felt crazy. It was like jumping out of a moving car into the middle of traffic just to see what it feels like to get run over. To make things more interesting, I had just been diagnosed with Lyme disease for a second time right before striking out on my own and my legs all but stopped working with both knees swollen to the size of cantaloupes.  </p><p class=\"\">I was scared to death, but I wasted no time in taking advantage of my newfound freedom.  I received an email inviting me to fly to Manama as a guest of the Princess of Bahrain to moderate several panels on AI and art. This invitation was exactly the type of out-of-the-blue opportunity I had been turning down in the past to hold down my nine-to-five office job. But along with the anxiety of having no job came the flexibility to jump on these opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578839787462-R3RDC6GCHPPYQNTKHGHT/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHiZpzp8X8d3F6YNawveyQd7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmecuz-7l2zM8l3lTx1MYTDTvZ3zfkkidV2he6LkLd1MUMiEYZP_U4oopykw0eo5li/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+9.35.49+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1494x1116\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Map on the back of the seat in front of me on the flight to Bahrain\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e1b2ee512be5b2164cc9e8b\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578839787462-R3RDC6GCHPPYQNTKHGHT/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHiZpzp8X8d3F6YNawveyQd7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmecuz-7l2zM8l3lTx1MYTDTvZ3zfkkidV2he6LkLd1MUMiEYZP_U4oopykw0eo5li/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+9.35.49+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Map on the back of the seat in front of me on the flight to Bahrain</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I'd never traveled to the Middle East and didn't know what to expect. I received a lot of well-intended but misguided warnings from my fellow Americans. They told me that Bahrain was dangerous and that I needed to be careful. I should dress modestly and pack only long-sleeved shirts and pants as not to show any excess skin. I'm a beer guy, and more than a few people warned me that there would be no beer and that I'd get arrested if I drank any alcohol. I received bad info.</p><p class=\"\">An hour after landing in Manama, I was partying at a bar on the balcony of a five-star hotel. It was a lax atmosphere, and nobody was dressed modestly except for me. I met a Bahraini that night at the bar who had just been to my home state Massachusetts to take his daughter to Boston Children's Hospital for a rare medical issue. It reminded me that we are all brothers and sisters just trying to do the best for our families. The world is a small place.  </p><p class=\"\">Bahrain was beautiful, and its people were warm and immediately welcoming. My hosts could not have been more accommodating and arranged excursions to museums and cultural sites, as well as fantastic and memorable meals. The best part was bonding not only with the locals, but the leading thinkers in art in tech whom they flew in from around the world. I built friendships there that have already changed the course of my life. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578743159326-XPPV3BXD5RNYP7NNGLY4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/UnfoldDay30056.JPG\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1667\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Left to right: Mario Klingemann, Robbie Barat, Aparajita Jain\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e19b56b9e4b0a7801ff684a\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578743159326-XPPV3BXD5RNYP7NNGLY4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/UnfoldDay30056.JPG?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Left to right: Mario Klingemann, Robbie Barat, Aparajita Jain</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">The first panel I moderated in Bahrain&nbsp;included two of the most important artists working with machine learning today: Mario Klingemann and Robbie Barrat.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/quasimondo\">Mario Klingemann</a> had just sold his work&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/298000366\"><em>Memories of Passersby</em></a>&nbsp;at Sotheby’s in London before flying to Bahrain.

Ideally it would start with early analog works of the late 1950s and range all the way up to the new work being done with machine learning in the last few years. To my knowledge, no such show has ever been curated. Just to attend such a show would be a dream come true for me. </p><p class=\"\">So when the <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/\">Kate Vass Galerie</a> proposed that I co-curate a show on the <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art\">history of generative art</a>, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. While I love early generative art, especially artists like Vera Molnar and Frieder Nake, my passion is really centered around contemporary generative art. So pairing up with my good friend Georg Bak, expert in early generative photography, was the perfect match.  Georg brings an unmatched passion and detailed understanding of early generative art that firmly plants this show in a deep and rich tradition that many have yet to learn about.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578851969780-WOD7G10C8VPZ73YIJ2HK/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOdLSQoRTi4bJzUmP3wBSdR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UavTk6Ork7w2g5SS8mRzPer3iEajcteVt8yfKoEdTjn67zs2yPjc1ECvpa5Zm_kMqw/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+12.30.50+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1764x1320\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Herbert W.

To give you an idea of the range in ages, we had both 19-year-old generative art prodigy Robbie Barrat and 91-year-old generative photography pioneer Herbert W. Franke at the opening. Thirty is an enormous amount of artists for a relatively small gallery, but we were able to pull it off because of the tireless work of both Kate Vass and her assistant Alessia Realis.

First, I presented with two lawyers next to a furnace in a basement at a street art fair. Then I moderated a panel in a room with projections from floor to ceiling on all four walls. On the next panel I hosted, they told us we had half as much time as we expected as we walked on stage, so I moderated in fast-forward. Finally, there was the keynote at Rare AF, which is always like a homecoming with so many very close friends there. I even got to carpool in to NYC for Rare AF with Joe Looney, the godfather of cryptoart.

Both years, Artnome advisor Anne Bracegirdle (now at <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/pace-gallery-pacex-1624546\">PaceX</a>)  played a central role in organizing the events and was kind enough to include me. </p><p class=\"\">For the 2019 summit, they gave me the freedom to chose my own topic.

Christie’s felt bad about overlooking Barrat’s work when they promoted work that relied heavily on his ideas and code. This gave him an opportunity to share his work and his thoughts. Robbie is incredibly well spoken as an artist and many people shared with me that our interview was the highlight of the summit.  </p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_NYaY8rU3h8?start=13434\" width=\"560\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\"></iframe><p class=\"\">The Art+Tech Summit has become one of the most important art and tech events of the year, and I hope Christie’s continues to host it.

In between floating in the lake and resting in the hammock, my family spoiled me by making me delicious meals.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578837662695-L0VI652F5OJB33O1076C/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCREdPyn30GOhOtwDccnWyl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYje-M3bISmb1z-j8PKgCoq0AR88Zt4XIRjeggDIYzVCOpYghpI-Ha_TwZsqqmJXng/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+9.00.09+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1518x1136\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Mobile office, Lake St. George, Liberty Maine\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e1b269b896438638126ebac\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578837662695-L0VI652F5OJB33O1076C/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCREdPyn30GOhOtwDccnWyl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYje-M3bISmb1z-j8PKgCoq0AR88Zt4XIRjeggDIYzVCOpYghpI-Ha_TwZsqqmJXng/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+9.00.09+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Mobile office, Lake St. George, Liberty Maine</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I also used this time to plan my next moves for Artnome. I am addicted to finding new and interesting digital art, but sometimes months go by where all the work I see starts to look the same. I was in that kind of a slump when I discovered artist Espen Kluge and his phenomenal <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/7/24/generative-portraiture-of-espen-kluge\">generative portraits</a>. I immediately fell in love, as did Kate, and we reached out to Espen for an interview and to offer him a <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/espen-kluge\">solo show</a> in November.</p><p class=\"\">I had also been speaking on and off with my close graduate school friend Fan Xiang who teaches design at Parsons in NYC and at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Fan had been following Artnome and wanted to arrange a speaking tour for me in China along with an exhibition of generative art. She ended up getting too busy, but introduced me to Professor CJ Chen from Nanjing University. The two of us become best friends right away. We decided to do an exhibition in November. </p><p class=\"\">So coming out of my midsummer break in the woods, I had committed to two more exhibitions: one in Switzerland and one in China. I also accepted a speaking engagement at Sotheby’s Institute to address the incoming class on the topic of art and tech. I agreed to write an article for <em>Art in America</em>. I then agreed to moderate a panel on machine learning at Art Basel Miami. The second half of my year was looking even busier than the first half.      </p><h2>Part 5 - Back-to-Back Shows in Switzerland and China</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578839419281-HFXG42TQRJ5PEA99ZCVT/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEAchlMisZxQ4xmPZCKFQZN7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UcAmAiEn7JuGRQV8fUGqo8vaEr4YHTLkTtny9ee6o4On3WUfc_ZsVm9Mi1E6FasEnQ/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+9.07.09+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1874x1250\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Left to right: Kate Vass, Jason Bailey, Espen Kluge\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e1b2d7589643863812772ec\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1578839419281-HFXG42TQRJ5PEA99ZCVT/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEAchlMisZxQ4xmPZCKFQZN7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UcAmAiEn7JuGRQV8fUGqo8vaEr4YHTLkTtny9ee6o4On3WUfc_ZsVm9Mi1E6FasEnQ/Screen+Shot+2020-01-12+at+9.07.09+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Left to right: Kate Vass, Jason Bailey, Espen Kluge</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I think of Switzerland as my home away from home now.

There, as everywhere else I went in China, I was treated with respect and gratitude and asked many deep and thoughtful questions about my work and research in art and tech. The head of the library took CJ and I, as well as our new friends from Europe who were also lecturing at the university, out to one of the nicest restaurants in Shanghai. </p><p class=\"\">The whole trip was amazing. If I can find a way, I’d like to move to Nanjing for a few years at some point to learn, teach, and lecture. I connected with people in China in a way I typically don’t in the US. I found everyone to be incredibly thoughtful, kind, and generous. I miss the professors and students I got to spend time with, and I think about them often and the unparalleled hospitality they showed me. They are family now. </p><h2>Artnome 2020</h2><p class=\"\">It is shaping up to be an another exciting year! In addition to the <em>Art in America</em> feature, I just recently completed a second commissioned piece for a publication (to be named later) that I really respect! I’ve already signed up to curate two shows: one in Montreal in March and one likely in Berlin in July (details forthcoming). I’ll be at SXSW (South by Southwest) in Austin in March with some amazing panelists to share how digital art can save the art market. It also looks like I will likely be presenting on new research I have been doing on art price prediction in NYC in the fall.  </p><p class=\"\">Thank you for all the support, and hopefully you found my recap of 2019 enjoyable! I get asked sometimes how all of these opportunities open up for me, and almost all of it starts with this blog. If you are passionate about something, I’d encourage you to write about it. You may not think you have time, but wake up an hour earlier each morning and you’d be surprised how much you can write. Don’t expect amazing things to happen right away — it takes the better part of a year before anyone will notice — but once they do, the world opens up to you and becomes your extended family. Cheers and best of luck in 2020 to you all! </p>","contentSnippet":"Podmork Portrait of Jason Bailey by Hackatao, 2019\nWhat a year for Artnome! An art exhibition in China, two more in Switzerland, an invitation from the Princess of Bahrain to moderate panels on AI, and presentations at both Christie’s and Sotheby’s. \nWe also had 28 blog posts, including guest posts by artists Casey Reas and David Young, as well as an interview with John Maeda on his new book How to Speak Machine.  We formed two business partnerships, both with companies founded by strong female entrepreneurs. The first partnership is with Kate Vass Galerie to promote up-and-coming digital artists and the second to fight art forgery using machine learning with Art Recognition.     \n2019 was Artnome’s best year by far, but 2020 is already giving it a run for its money. We are thrilled to share that we have officially kicked off the year by writing the cover story for the January edition of Art in America!   \nArt in America, January 2020. Photo and cover art by Sougwan Chung\nHow did all this happen? I keep waiting for things to slow down so I can document it and make sense of it all, but the time never comes. So this past week I woke up at 4:00 a.m. instead of my usual 5:00 a.m. to find the time to write it all down to share with you, because without you, there is no Artnome!\nPart I - Quit My Job With No Plan And Fly to Bahrain\nMcDonalds in the Manama Airport, Bahrain\nIn January of 2019, after four incredible years at Tamr, one of the hottest machine learning startups in Boston, I decided it was time to take a leap and pursue Artnome more aggressively. Leaving a fantastic job with a great team and with no idea how I would make money felt crazy. It was like jumping out of a moving car into the middle of traffic just to see what it feels like to get run over. To make things more interesting, I had just been diagnosed with Lyme disease for a second time right before striking out on my own and my legs all but stopped working with both knees swollen to the size of cantaloupes.  \nI was scared to death, but I wasted no time in taking advantage of my newfound freedom.  I received an email inviting me to fly to Manama as a guest of the Princess of Bahrain to moderate several panels on AI and art. This invitation was exactly the type of out-of-the-blue opportunity I had been turning down in the past to hold down my nine-to-five office job. But along with the anxiety of having no job came the flexibility to jump on these opportunities.\nMap on the back of the seat in front of me on the flight to Bahrain\nI'd never traveled to the Middle East and didn't know what to expect. I received a lot of well-intended but misguided warnings from my fellow Americans. They told me that Bahrain was dangerous and that I needed to be careful. I should dress modestly and pack only long-sleeved shirts and pants as not to show any excess skin. I'm a beer guy, and more than a few people warned me that there would be no beer and that I'd get arrested if I drank any alcohol.

I thought I had lost the files for my thesis but recently checked with Blurb, where I had it published over a decade ago and was excited to find they still had a copy.</p><p class=\"\">Some of the ideas in my thesis are a bit cringeworthy ten years on, but it is still the most singular representation of who am I am and how and why I think the way I do as a creative. A lot of Artnome readers know me as a writer, but my thesis focuses on my most active years as a designer and generative artist (2000-2010). It also references the many years I spent before graduate school focused on traditional studio art like painting, printmaking, and sculpture (1990-2000). While it is not a short thesis, I made sure to write it in my voice and to avoid traditional academic-speak. It is more autobiographical than academic, and If you are interested in the creative process and the digital transformation artists and designers have gone through in the last several decades, you might find it a worthwhile read.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">I had told myself I'd publish my thesis on Artnome if I ever had a month where I was too busy to write a new article. This month I have been lucky enough to be writing commissioned pieces for two well-known publications I respect and admire (which I'm psyched to share soon) and did not get a chance to publish anything fresh to Artnome. Not wanting to break an almost three-year streak, I decided it was time to share my master's thesis, ten years on from when I originally finished it.

This experience provided me an opportunity to examine my world in much closer detail than I otherwise do in daily life.</p><p class=\"\">In my day job drawing has also meant taking highly technical information, like the complex physics involved in a car accident, and boiling it down into an easily understood graphic so that others might understand it better; or illustrating statistical data, like the variable temperature in a data center, and turning an overwhelming list of numbers into a clear visual story.</p><p class=\"\">Drawing has also been about journey and discovery for me, often starting without clearly defined objectives and letting the process unfold and dictate the outcome and not always drawing the reality that is in front of me but creating a new reality. Paul Klee described this process elegantly when he stated: \"Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible. \" (Chipp, 182) It is this last aspect of drawing that I have always enjoyed the most.</p><p class=\"\">This mode of drawing allows me to find questions that I wouldn’t otherwise think to ask. The process has always delivered me better ideas than simply brainstorming or even writing.</p><p class=\"\">Throughout my life, I have changed the tools I use for drawing, starting at a young age with markers, crayons, and pencil, eventually learning to paint with oils and watercolors. Painting is a process that I still consider drawing, only with a brush. In my undergraduate studies, I learned to make linoleum prints and then intaglio prints (etchings, drypoint, etc.). And then it happened... about eight years ago I started using the computer as a drawing tool. Now I use it almost exclusively. It wasn't until the last year of my graduate program that I asked myself, \"Why?\"</p><p class=\"\">At first, I thought I used computers to draw because that was the only way I could make a career of doing what I have always loved most: drawing. There was a good argument for this, as I don't know anyone personally who lives off of drawing without using a computer (with the exception of a family friend who is employed full-time as a political cartoonist). There had to be more to this permanent switch in tools, so I asked myself what computers are good at and came up with a list of six key things.</p><p class=\"\">I decided computers are good at illustrating space and time, facilitating interaction by managing input and output, storing and presenting data, running and storing complex algorithms, and distributing information to a large audience at little or no cost.</p><p class=\"\">When I thought about this list relative to the history of drawing, I made a dramatic realization that these issues have long been of primary interest to artists using analog drawing tools. The computer was not just a fancy calculator for crunching numbers, but also a natural extension of the history of drawing.</p><p class=\"\">For example, Marcel Duchamp's painting Nude Descending a Staircase explores several themes from my list. In this painting, Duchamp is playing with the Cubist algorithms for the deconstruction of space, reducing the figure into simplified geometry and displaying it from several angles. He goes beyond space and tries to represent time by showing the figure in multiple positions on the same static 2D canvas, which also suggests motion. Unlike more representational paintings, Duchamp's painting required the user to interpret or decode the visual system of the painting to see the movement of the figure and better understand the complex space it occupies.</p><p class=\"\">Duchamp was also one of the first artists to draw attention to distribution in an increasingly mass-produced society. His ready-made sculptures, like Fountain, an everyday urinal, challenged the viewer to question the value placed on art as craftsmanship and one-of-a-kind artifacts by executing the conceptual act of placing a machined, mass-produced object in a gallery.</p><p class=\"\">The more time I spent thinking back to art history and the history of my drawing process, the more confident I became that the affordances of the computer were a match for the historical objectives of drawing.</p><p class=\"\">Using the computer, I am able to build and display models of 3D space on a 2D plane, generate drawings that change over time, turn data into drawings, write algorithms to generate near-infinite visual iterations of my work, distribute my work to a larger audience, and allow for greater interaction from that audience.</p><p class=\"\">The computer also provides me a means for pushing drawing in new directions beyond its analog origins. When digitized, all media share a common language of ones and zeros, allowing for uniquely digital, cross-pollination of media. For example, I can now make drawings with data taken from sound or compose music with data from video. My thesis is of a series of stories describing the process behind several of my drawing projects, both digital and analog. I have tried to capture the discoveries I made about the computer, how I use it as a drawing tool, and how it has changed the way I work as an artist.</p><p class=\"\">What I learned from my projects is that it is best to involve people at every stage of development and that taking this approach is not only more effective but more fun. This was counter to my instincts of going off and developing things in isolation based on theories of interactions. Sharing the process was more important than sharing the results. For this reason, I decided to write primarily about my process in my thesis. I wanted to tell stories, stories of successes, and stories of failures, in the hope that others may learn from my experiences as I have from theirs.</p><h2>Space</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577678280763-FPMCB5DFFOPEZG7QUYRA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kESscqE5wbWTEVfXBP4EgfF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UbRA74NcJjZ0it_NZ07I606yUhThlDX36rcoNJjhQI3voRwB-dUGsSquCnVTFQcaRg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-29+at+10.57.28+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1934x1628\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Study #2, Processing - Jason Bailey (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0975c181e14d1a2531aea7\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577678280763-FPMCB5DFFOPEZG7QUYRA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kESscqE5wbWTEVfXBP4EgfF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UbRA74NcJjZ0it_NZ07I606yUhThlDX36rcoNJjhQI3voRwB-dUGsSquCnVTFQcaRg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-29+at+10.57.28+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Study #2, Processing - Jason Bailey (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I grew up Mormon and spent a lot of time drawing during the long Sunday services. I remember my dad being about as disinterested in the service as I was. The upside to this was that he would show me drawing tricks to keep me busy.</p><p class=\"\">On one such occasion, he drew a square and then a second square diagonally offset from the first square. He connected the corners, and something magical happened. The two squares became a cube that seemed to jump off the page. Seeing how impressed I was, he followed the first trick by connecting two triangles and then two circles. Each time he made a new shape, I was more impressed. For a kid who spent as much time drawing flat airplanes, flat horses, and flat ninjas as I did, this was a pretty amazing trick. Not only was it possible to describe 3D space on a 2D plane, but it also appeared to be incredibly simple using the tricks he showed me.</p><p class=\"\">As with most people learning to draw, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the perspective and how to properly recreate the three-dimensional world around me on a two-dimensional plane. As an undergraduate student, I spent hundreds of hours drawing. This was when I realized that drawing complex shapes with proper perspective was a time-consuming and challenging task. Even drawing something as simple as an empty dorm room with a couple of shelves, some books, and a few bricks of Ramen noodles could take several hours to get right. Organic shapes like fruits or faces were even more difficult.</p><p class=\"\">Learning to use 3D graphics programs on the computer restored the magic to the illusion of creating three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional plane.&nbsp; This is what I had seen when my father showed me how to make that first cube. With the computer, I could simply push and pull surfaces in any direction I wanted, and the proper perspective would be calculated by the computer and applied to the scene. The idea that I can create a single model and show it from any angle without restarting the drawing process from scratch remains intriguing to me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577677792202-F53L50VQU43BF06KQXN4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLHbMC3rV78LIK1J0TjB7FR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0i3EvU4t4qBXvqGDXWGZvhPMcuCkgzSq9kPNfpt4N7nCli5vrxmLWWIKvIlmOd4jnw/Tubes.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1060\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"3D Study #1, Processing, Jason Bailey (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0973db13bb831c9c5c7795\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577677792202-F53L50VQU43BF06KQXN4/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLHbMC3rV78LIK1J0TjB7FR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0i3EvU4t4qBXvqGDXWGZvhPMcuCkgzSq9kPNfpt4N7nCli5vrxmLWWIKvIlmOd4jnw/Tubes.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">3D Study #1, Processing, Jason Bailey (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>3D Brush Tool</strong></p><p class=\"\">As the colorful and repeating sequence of rotating 3D shapes followed the cursor I was controlling with my mouse across my computer screen, I thought to myself, is this just more eye candy, or is there something here?</p><p class=\"\">From over my shoulder, I heard my classmate Simon let out a coo of joy, followed by a giggle.

I had spent the first week exploring the 3D capabilities of the Processing programming language.

Hearing Simon's positive response to the drawing program I wrote and seeing that he immediately wanted to try it reassured me that there was some potential for an engaging project here.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577795208897-IBDUFY7UZ887N0AEFYX9/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLHbMC3rV78LIK1J0TjB7FR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0i3EvU4t4qBXvqGDXWGZvhPMcuCkgzSq9kPNfpt4N7nCli5vrxmLWWIKvIlmOd4jnw/Red.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1060\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Study #4, Processing - Jason Bailey (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b3e8603dac823b7e43f10\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577795208897-IBDUFY7UZ887N0AEFYX9/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLHbMC3rV78LIK1J0TjB7FR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0i3EvU4t4qBXvqGDXWGZvhPMcuCkgzSq9kPNfpt4N7nCli5vrxmLWWIKvIlmOd4jnw/Red.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Study #4, Processing - Jason Bailey (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I had some light experience in programming languages and a background in 3D graphics, but had tried and failed several times to marry the two. Knowing that I would want more than just the simple boxes and spheres that Processing provided by default, I looked into methods for bringing more complex models from Maya into Processing for further manipulation and interaction. After finding a library of code to support the transfer of files from Maya to Processing, I began experimenting with building and animating the models first in Maya, and then manipulating them in Processing. Initially, I created models of real-life objects, such as a table, lamp, etc. I wanted to make an interactive space, populated with realistic 3D models, similar to those in video games. Pretty quickly, I realized that even Processing would have difficulty rendering lifelike objects with textures and lighting in real-time. I decided instead to experiment with animating some abstract geometric shapes. I set up a processing sketch that would rotate my animated 3D meshes as the user dragged them around the screen. The resulting images looked pretty unique. It felt like a novel direction to move in.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577795023706-2KYY0FOT3XRPPZXMP6GQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHUozN4I2WW5CO06LmDgF1l7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UboYgDr_UwUrXGdsyP35RozcUX4TqdBARftny2imMdZMMW9u6oXQZQicHHG1WEE6fg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+7.23.06+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1938x1630\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 7.23.06 AM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b3dcd014e1a25d2b05552\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577795023706-2KYY0FOT3XRPPZXMP6GQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHUozN4I2WW5CO06LmDgF1l7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UboYgDr_UwUrXGdsyP35RozcUX4TqdBARftny2imMdZMMW9u6oXQZQicHHG1WEE6fg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+7.23.06+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I was excited about the 3D brush project but equally excited about the next several projects in the Processing class, so I put the 3D brush project on the back burner. Knowing that I wanted to revisit the 3D brush project, I signed up for an independent study in the fall of 2009. I had been looking at the algorithmic work of other designers, such as the work of Jared Tarbell. Tarbell's programming and design process resonated with my process. In describing the creation of his algorithmic drawing, Substrate, he emphasizes the experimentation and discovery involved in programming drawings: \"Before writing the program, I only had a vague idea of what it might look like. It wasn't until the first couple of bug-free executions that I realized something incredible was happening. The resulting form was much more complex than the originating algorithm. This particular quality of software is what keeps me interested.\" (Fry, 157)</p><p class=\"\">Tarbell's programmed sketches were intriguing to me for the painterly effects he achieved with them. Although generated entirely from code, Tarbell's images had a feeling of human gesture that was less present or not present at all in the work of other designers creating algorithm-driven artwork. I started thinking about designing a tool that would balance out the automated but organic results of Tarbell's algorithmic drawings with some degree of control from the user.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577795587140-YVP4VJNFG70ORPV2US4M/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHUozN4I2WW5CO06LmDgF1l7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UboYgDr_UwUrXGdsyP35RozcUX4TqdBARftny2imMdZMMW9u6oXQZQicHHG1WEE6fg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+7.32.29+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1938x1630\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Torus Brush, Processing.

The donut shape repeated its animated dance in an endless loop and left a trail of the previous frames in its wake. I spent several days experimenting with this shape, using wireframes, different lighting scenarios, color randomization, and increasing and decreasing the scale. I eventually settled on a scale that seemed appropriate for a drawing application, not so large that it immediately filled up the screen yet not so small that the details of the ever-evolving 3D mesh would get lost for the user. After becoming more comfortable with using the tool to draw, I learned how to balance out the idiosyncratic rhythm of the evolving shape with the control I did have over the motion of the brush.</p><p class=\"\">It struck me during the development of this drawing program that my programming process and my drawing process were very similar. Casey Reas, co-creator of the Processing language, describes the similarities of the two processes: ”As with other types of art, software may be written through a process of intuitive exploration, and it can be written precisely to meet a goal.” (Reas) I would often approach the code by making a small adjustment, sitting back and evaluating its impact on the overall image, and then going in and fine-tuning the code. As with drawing, I did not have complete control over the outcome, as I allowed for experimentation and surprises to influence both the code and the drawing.</p><h2>Time</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577795760845-A9QGO8YBDIDA2BX0Y2JQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kH3t5KrhwlngWBLY013j_xt7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UZiyBHWcNVVQJEX-TvxlXpqAyw9Qn9FObi2GqE6j5FFU7zs2yPjc1ECvpa5Zm_kMqw/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+7.35.18+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1934x1634\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Home Office, Processing.

Seeing that we were interested in filtering video, Mike set aside some class time to explain how digital video is drawn to the screen, and how real-time filters can be written in Processing to affect the display. I have worked with digital video editing software for about ten years now, cutting and pasting clips, adding music and titles, and occasionally adding filters for color correction or transitions between clips. Software like Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro has made it possible to edit video without ever understanding how it is pulled into the camera and drawn to the screen.</p><p class=\"\">As Mike explained to us, video is drawn to the screen, many frames per second, pixel-by-pixel, left to right. It starts in the upper left corner of the screen, moves to the right corner, when it hits the right side of the screen, it then moves down a row, similar to the motion of a typewriter. Despite the speed at which this all happens, we can ask each pixel for information about its position on the screen, its color value, and its brightness. More amazing was discovering that these values can be changed on the fly.</p><p class=\"\">With this new information, video had become a much more exciting area to explore. The next week in Mike's class, we were discussing how you can measure the difference between two different colors using a vector math function and the RGB values for each color. Although I still don't understand precisely how vector math works, I recognized this function as the same one I used to find the distance between XYZ points in my 3D programming projects. I had an epiphany that if I could use the same function to measure a series of three numbers for color values as I did for three points in space, and there might be some interesting visual mapping opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577798328721-XK5U94ZUQAVOF4CUPO0J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC-7zLYtziGHRxNu5YQhy4B7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYbe49nbGQL5yUqlyCRD8XmJ79Bj_m9Z5L-QBmfLvgzx3WUfc_ZsVm9Mi1E6FasEnQ/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+8.17.21+AM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1874x1580\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Gallery Sequence, Processing, Jason Bailey (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b4aa58818570cab5fbf95\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577798328721-XK5U94ZUQAVOF4CUPO0J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC-7zLYtziGHRxNu5YQhy4B7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYbe49nbGQL5yUqlyCRD8XmJ79Bj_m9Z5L-QBmfLvgzx3WUfc_ZsVm9Mi1E6FasEnQ/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+8.17.21+AM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Gallery Sequence, Processing, Jason Bailey (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I wrote a program that would read every frame of a movie, get the average color of the pixels for that frame, and then correlate the R value to the X position, the G value to the Y position, and the B value to the Z position on the screen. Often the color for a frame would average out to some shade of gray, and the frames from the video would cluster around the center of the screen. Every once in a while, a dominantly red frame would move off to the right, a green frame moved to the top of the screen, or a blue frame would move forward in Z space. I experimented with using the position of the brightest pixel in each frame to dictate the position of each frame as well, trying to get better separation.

Although not complete, I thought I could benefit from watching people interact with my project.</p><p class=\"\">I’m not sure who he was, but one gentleman at the opening leaned over with curiosity and stared into the lens of my webcam, which lay resting on the white pedestal in the gallery. Clearly restraining himself from touching the camera (after all, it was in a gallery and it can be hard to tell what you are allowed to touch and what is off-limits), his eyeball was only about 3 inches away from the lens of the camera when he finally backed away and looked at the projection on the wall. There it was, the still image of his eyeball, projected as a plane in space, on the gallery wall, next to hundreds of other images taken from the camera during the previous 30 or so minutes. He went back to the camera, put his hand in front of it, stepped back again, and searched for the image of his hand on the wall, smiled, and then walked away.&nbsp; </p><p class=\"\"><strong>Collage Tool</strong></p><p class=\"\">I believe it was a motorcycle. I had been cutting up comic strips from the Sunday edition of The Boston Globe and blowing them up into large abstract shapes on the Xerox machine in the Whittemore Library at Framingham State College.</p><p class=\"\">It was 1997. Scanners probably existed then, but I did not have access to one and would likely not have the technical skill required to operate one. The stylized engine and exhaust pipe of the cartoon motorcycle had these long elegant lines that I knew would work nicely in my collage. I was working on one of the many inspiring art projects assigned by professor John Anderson in my 2D design class. The assignment required us to use the photocopy machine to blow up the simplified, familiar images into several abstract compositions exploring the balance of negative and positive space and variation of line weight. I had never done anything like this before, and developing a library of shapes that I could freely move around in combinations to create a new composition was enjoyable.</p><p class=\"\">The forms that emerged were complex and exciting in ways that I would not have discovered if I were creating a preconceived abstract drawing. The element of chance and the speed with which I could experiment with new compositions by sifting through and juxtaposing images made this a memorable experience for me.</p><p class=\"\">This project was memorable enough that over ten years later, it served as inspiration for a project at the Dynamic Media Institute. It was the process of creating these collages and not the results that were so memorable and engaging for me. I decided to try and capture that process with a digital interface. This would require me to think about time and motion, two elements that were not present in the static drawings, paintings, and illustrations I had created in the past. I put together a proposal for a time-based, interactive collage tool: \"The tool would be based on the juxtaposition of simple 2D shapes to make more complex shapes. The interface would save the compositions created by the users into a database and play them back as inspiration for future users. When you approach the interface, the shapes would move about the screen, occasionally assuming the compositions created by previous users. The current user could freeze the screen at any time and then rearrange the shapes, controlling position, scale, and rotation to form more complex imagery. Ideally, the results would express a meaningful and creative co-authorship between user and toolmaker.\"</p><p class=\"\">I had been researching creativity and ways of facilitating it in users through the design of the interface. One person who fascinated me in my research was Will Wright, the inventor of Sim City, The Sims, and Spore. At the time, I was trying to figure out if engaging people in the creative process was something that just happened or if there were design decisions that could increase the likelihood of success. Wright was of particular interest to me because he had developed wildly successful and engaging interfaces that allowed users to combine existing elements already present in the game creatively. I figured there had to be some type of formula for creative engagement. I was determined to figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577817125577-Q77X4U9G840XDX0EYDWR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAkWMaI-1R2VAJL9-rOq1tl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVuuLilWBXe-A4BZI80yr_llTTAebio58f08zAl-jt39OpYghpI-Ha_TwZsqqmJXng/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.31.26+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2086x1646\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 1.31.26 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b942503dac823b7eca380\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577817125577-Q77X4U9G840XDX0EYDWR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAkWMaI-1R2VAJL9-rOq1tl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVuuLilWBXe-A4BZI80yr_llTTAebio58f08zAl-jt39OpYghpI-Ha_TwZsqqmJXng/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.31.26+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">In reading everything I could find about Wright, I found this quote from him: \"What is the simplest possible system that I can build, that for you is going to decompress into the most elaborate set of possibilities?\" (Moggridge, 381) This elegant statement made a lot of sense to me. I had thought that interfaces that facilitated creative experiences came from complexity, and that complexity came from a wide variety of available actions and components upon which to act. What I was missing was that complexity can stem from simplicity. I realized that I wanted to try and design a simple system that could unfold over time into a more complex series of interactions. I thought back to the simple collage project that I had worked on in my 2D design class and how it had constraints for components and had simple rules but also served as an engaging system for the creative process. I decided to use it as the inspiration for a digital collage interface. I needed to find some interesting shapes that people could use in combination to create more interesting shapes. I decided to vectorize several artworks from 20th Century artists, including Jean Dubuffet, Jean Arp, and the collage work of Henri Mattise, and break them apart to provide a library of shapes. These artists appealed to me for this project because their work includes simple, graphic, hard-edged forms.</p><p class=\"\">I knew I wanted people to be able to combine these forms, rotate them freely, and change the scale, just as I had in my Xerox collage project, only this time with a computer. I was worried that this experience might not be as fun in a digital environment, so before I started coding up the interface for scaling and rotating the shapes, I played with the shapes in Illustrator, making several compositions. Convinced that this was worth exploring, I moved forward with my programming.</p><p class=\"\">While experimenting with Illustrator, I realized the steps required to move, rotate, and scale the shapes were quite complex. Brainstorming ways to reduce this complexity, I came up with an idea for a single-click interface that would cycle through functionality but use the same gestures. I centralized the code so that each shape was an object with the same behavior; I could have one shape or a thousand shapes using the same amount of code. When you clicked on the shape, it went into the first stage of interaction, and you could drag it around the screen, juxtaposing it with other images. A faster gesture with the mouse would throw the shape across the screen, bouncing off the edges until it decelerated to a complete stop. A second click allowed the user to rotate the shape by moving the mouse to the left or to the right; changing the scale was accomplished by moving the mouse up or down.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577818147592-0FS490KZOHUCB2YZX69G/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.48.44+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1640\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 1.48.44 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b9823014e1a25d2b9470f\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577818147592-0FS490KZOHUCB2YZX69G/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.48.44+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">After many months of programming, I had an interface with which I was happy. I had solved several technical problems, devised a novel method for scaling and rotating shapes, and the motion felt entirely organic.</p><p class=\"\">However, I was reluctant to have anyone use my interface. What if all of this work resulted in a dud? I eventually brought a variation of the interface into class and had several classmates try it out. While they had fun with it, none of them created the collage-type images I had in mind. I had worked in isolation too long and made too many assumptions. Developing a single formula for facilitating creative engagement was starting to feel like a pretty weak idea, but it didn't stop me from further researching this idea.</p><p class=\"\">Studying Will Wright led me to more research on complexity derived from simple systems. Wright had mentioned Conway's Game of Life and cellular automata as a source of inspiration, so I decided to investigate this further. Cellular automata are \"grid-based systems that vaguely resemble game boards.\" The squares or cells can become occupied or vacant based on a simple set of rules, which often lead to complex, emergent behavior. Conway's Game of life, created in 1970 by mathematician John Conway, is probably the best-known example of cellular automata. His rules dictated that an occupied cell would be \"alive,\" and vacant cells would be \"dead.\"</p><p class=\"\">When set into motion, each cell would change based over time based on the state of its neighbors. The fantastic part about these simple systems is the variety and complexity of patterns that emerge. (Salen, 161) I was starting to understand why Conway was so inspirational to Will Wright in creating his games. Because Wright used only simple rules and few components, his games were easy to learn, but his understanding of systems meant the games had an extremely diverse set of outcomes. This again started to sound like a formula that could be applied to a tool for image-making, whether it be drawing, collage, or building.</p><p class=\"\">I became more interested in systems and simulations as a means of creative engagement. A classmate suggested I pick up a copy of Mitchel Resnick's book Turtles, Termites &amp; Trafic Jams. In his book, Resnick describes the development of Starlogo, a program Resnick wrote for students to model and simulate the behavior of decentralized systems like traffic jams. Before StarLogo, Resnick had been working with students to learn about decentralized systems using one of his other projects, Lego/Logo, and realized it was not the ideal environment. He explains: \"To explore phenomena like these, I decided to go back to the computer screen, to work with virtual creatures in virtual worlds. Virtual worlds offer many advantages. In virtual worlds, it is easy to create large numbers of creatures. It is easy to give new sensory capabilities to the creatures. And it is easy to set up and control precise experimental conditions.\" (Resnick, 31) Like Will Wright's Sim City, Resnick's StarLogo interested me for the variety of potential outcomes the user could arrive at while manipulating only a small number of components. At this stage in my studies, I was doing more reading than making. After reading Turtles, Termites &amp; Trafic Jams, I was hungry for more reading on systems. In browsing the bookshelves at the local book store, I came across Noah Waldrip-Fruin's book Expressive Processing. In the introduction, he states: \"...computational processes are an increasingly significant means of expression for authors. Rather than define the sequence of the words for a book or images for a film, today's authors are increasingly defining rules for system behavior.\" (Fruin, 3) I was now more convinced than ever that all the important people were creating systems, authoring experiences through the development of rules.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577818081960-WJNCPCK2U4IGRB1806EN/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kD0KmXm3VskWjf-r407_8m57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UW6FrdBPtUcHNJURqGoBXlrhBSwF595MAGPOxFSEc7R1oRwB-dUGsSquCnVTFQcaRg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.47.27+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1638\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 1.47.27 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b97df03dac823b7ed23d3\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577818081960-WJNCPCK2U4IGRB1806EN/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kD0KmXm3VskWjf-r407_8m57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UW6FrdBPtUcHNJURqGoBXlrhBSwF595MAGPOxFSEc7R1oRwB-dUGsSquCnVTFQcaRg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.47.27+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">It was the beginning of my last summer at DMI, and I started feeling the pressure to come up with a thesis project. Inspired by everything I had been learning about simulations and systems, I started a second attempt at creating an interface that would allow the user to set simple components into motion with the hope that these components would evolve into interesting compositions over time. I had a decent understanding of the Processing programming language, and I was impressed with its 3D capabilities. Inspired by the simplicity of the Lego building system and my research on systems and cellular automata, I set out to design a simpler version of the collage project in a 3D environment. This was an unusual approach for me to prove a project idea based on reading and having a detailed plan of what the project would be before starting to make it. After several weeks of programming, reading tutorials, and \"borrowing\" code, I had an empty environment full of gray cubes that would highlight in red when selected. Once selected, you could move the cubes around the screen and combine them to make more complex shapes. After you built up a model with the simple cubes, you could apply simulated physics to make the model fall apart. This was my attempt at further applying the idea of simplicity leading to complexity as a means of generating an interface that could facilitate creativity in the user.</p><p class=\"\">I had my friends and classmates try the interface. The general response was that it was impressive from a programming standpoint, but the glitches it did have prevented people from wanting to build and explore with the interface for very long. While this was a significant success for me from a technical perspective and a vast improvement on past projects, it was still missing something. It was not engaging the user. I also felt like working with such a predetermined outcome was unnatural for me. It felt more forced and less enjoyable, not as open to chance and discovery. I was trying too hard to push my process to mirror the research I had done on simulation and systems.</p><h2>Interaction</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577818301735-DJ8165ZXTLROVGIF7814/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.51.12+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1640\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 1.51.12 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0b98b69df9c819e0e52582\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577818301735-DJ8165ZXTLROVGIF7814/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+1.51.12+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">\"Art teachers are the biggest bullshit artists on the planet!\" Oh, my God, I thought, what have I done? It was my first day as a high school student teacher.</p><p class=\"\">I was hardly a year or two older than most of the high school students in the classroom, and the student who just called me a wannabe “bullshit artist” looked like he was a year or two older than me and wanted to beat my face in. I forget his name, but he had the same stupid glower of the seemingly infinite number of jocks that had made my own experience as a high school student so miserable.</p><p class=\"\">I had voluntarily gone back to hell. Somewhere in my head, I thought that being a high school art teacher would allow me to help struggling students find purpose and shelter like my art teacher had done for me. I had forgotten that art is a requirement for all high school students to graduate, and the majority of those students would rather be playing kickball or doing just about anything other than sitting in art class. I don't mean to imply that they weren't good kids; it's just that not everybody is that into the whole art thing.</p><p class=\"\">Some of the students enjoyed being there and enjoyed the projects they were working on. There was the kid with bushy black hair riddled with dandruff drawing an army of robots in compromising positions. The girl with no eyelashes and cigarette burns on her arms, drawing a beautiful still-life with colored pencils and cray-pas. And the painfully stereotypical teacher's pet: a bright, smiling Chinese girl with a Dartmouth College sweatshirt. She had single-handedly resuscitated the ceramic kiln from near extinction and proudly displayed a long row of elegantly crafted organic vessels. Two years earlier, I would have been hanging out with these three kids after school, perhaps even starting a crappy garage band with them. They were my people.</p><p class=\"\">For the majority of the semester, I just watched and took notes as Mrs. B. directed her classroom. She was a great teacher, but I couldn't help but notice how all the students worked in isolation. Their projects seemed too precious to them. They were afraid to try new things for fear of failure and judgment. I remembered these observations when Mrs. B. gave me an opportunity to create an assignment of my own, and thus, full control over the class.</p><p class=\"\">There was a graffiti problem at school. They sandblasted one side of the building several times that semester. I remember thinking about how the anonymity of that act of graffiti must have been freeing for a high school student under constant surveillance and scrutiny. Inspired by these anonymous acts of graffiti and a desire to get the students to collaborate, I decided that my assignment would involve each student drawing on a large piece of paper for one minute and then passing it to the person on their right. They would do this until they received the drawing they had initiated.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577828925675-XT9E9G1FTGN67ULRV9SD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kG7H9LIvcO3jUmLQMjzp8pV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lADW3oK1mvqSKJ2IaVAwqU-88sRPrZGORHHMI4I8RVl9aTiUe8tlifJMthbyA6HTg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.48.00+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1052\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 4.48.00 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc23aca0564159dceb41c\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577828925675-XT9E9G1FTGN67ULRV9SD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kG7H9LIvcO3jUmLQMjzp8pV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0lADW3oK1mvqSKJ2IaVAwqU-88sRPrZGORHHMI4I8RVl9aTiUe8tlifJMthbyA6HTg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.48.00+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I brought in my cheap dorm room CD player so I could play inspiring music for them while they worked. Before playing a selection from some crazy experimental sound band from the '90s (Praxis, I think), I laid down the ground rules of the assignment. I told them the only rules were to draw for that one minute and then pass to the right. I didn't care what they drew. I told them I would not censor them. \"Serious? We can draw anything?\" they asked before letting out a collective giggle. \"Anything you want,\" I said. I started the music, set a timer, and said: \"go.\"</p><p class=\"\">Everyone started drawing with an urgency. Some drew hearts and smiley faces; others drew abstract squiggles; some chose to write words. It was awesome. One student decided to draw the same image of two stick figures having sex over and over again. Another student further down the line was offended by the X-rated stick figures and would turn them into lowers, rainbows, or just cross them out. In the end, there were 30 unique compositions created by the class as a whole. We were able to critique them openly because there was no single clear author.</p><p class=\"\">Mrs. B. hung them side by side like a giant graffiti wall in the hall outside the art room.

Turning drawing into an exercise in socialization and interaction, instead of isolation, appeals to me. It puts more emphasis on process, the part I value most, and less on the quality of the artifact or finished piece.</p><p class=\"\">Entering into my final year at DMI, I realized I had worked on several projects that I intended to be platforms for collaboration, but always hesitated to bring them to the level of user testing for fear that they would fall flat. Initially, I thought an interface with a blank screen that allowed users to collaborate in 3D was the way to go. I had tried Second Life and several other spinoffs and found them to be too cluttered for intense collaboration.</p><p class=\"\">In my second semester at DMI, I decided to try and create a minimalist collaborative environment where people could develop models and make drawings together in three dimensions. The environment would combine 3D software like Autodesk Maya and Google Sketchup, with the networking capabilities and social interaction of Second Life. It would be a blank canvas without artificial terrain and over-the-top avatars, or so I hoped.</p><p class=\"\">Knowing my limitations in programming, I sought out a platform to build upon that would already have resolved the 3D elements such as cameras, texture mapping, and navigation. I eventually settled on Croquet, a program that Alan Kay developed along with several other computer graphics luminaries. According to the Croquet consortium website, Croquet is “a powerful open source software technology that, in the form of the Croquet Software Developer’s Kit (Croquet SDK), can be used by experienced software developers to create and deploy deeply collaborative multiuser online virtual world applications on and across multiple operating systems and devices.” (Croquet)</p><p class=\"\">I must have glossed over the part about “used by experienced programmers” because I spent the better part of a semester trying to resolve technical challenges to get a prototype of my empty 3D world up and running. At the end of the semester, I presented a blank screen with a simple grid on which several people could log in as 3D chicken avatars and draw in 3D space. I planned on replacing the chicken avatars with floating 2D planes mapped with live webcam video, but was not able to make the changes in time for the presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829080833-ZU6IT9EXGNCRB194GA4F/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC9-CqyT896GZeuGo8Um2ld7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmYSRCAz8qohjO1AuzPLnScN88i-Q_q9lM-hOdqavO6uRGR7s6npmp22Y3bFCrZS33/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.50.41+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1438x1092\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Croquet collaborative drawing prototype\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc2d803dac823b7f2b9af\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829080833-ZU6IT9EXGNCRB194GA4F/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC9-CqyT896GZeuGo8Um2ld7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmYSRCAz8qohjO1AuzPLnScN88i-Q_q9lM-hOdqavO6uRGR7s6npmp22Y3bFCrZS33/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.50.41+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Croquet collaborative drawing prototype</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">The presentation was a flop. The silly-looking chickens on the minimalist background combined with the awkward drawing tools, and the inability to demo live without crashing, made it difficult to express my intentions. Because getting the platform up and running that semester used up the bulk of my time, the majority of the project relied on existing tools and functionality already built into Croquet. It took another two semesters before my classmates stopped picking on me for my chicken drawing collaborative interface.</p><p class=\"\">Although I had been thinking of this collaborative 3D environment as a potential thesis project, I abandoned it as there were too many technical challenges, and I had sensed little to no interest from people in using such a tool.</p><p class=\"\">I decided that I needed to do more research on collaboration and creativity to make my future projects more successful. I read book after book about systems, game design, interaction design, design patterns, and the philosophy of creativity in the hope that they would lead me to a set of best practices for designing interfaces that would facilitate creative interaction. By this point in my thesis development, I had realized that I wanted to focus on drawing as an interface for creativity. Still, I also realized that my approach to researching in books for a set of rules for designing creative interactive interfaces was becoming counterproductive.</p><p class=\"\">Luckily, at the start of my final year at school, I realized what was missing from my previous collaborative projects: collaboration. I had come up with these projects in isolation. I worked by myself at the computer for long hours with a predetermined vision of a finished piece and lots of false assumptions about how people would interact with my projects.</p><p class=\"\">It was around this time that I had a conversation with Dennis Ludvino, a classmate of mine who was working on a collaborative writing environment that had a lot of crossover with my interests in creating a collaborative drawing environment. I approached him about “collaborating” on making a shared canvas together. He thought it was a great idea, so we started working out the details. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I made while at DMI.</p><p class=\"\">We started by using a pre-built Processing sketch that would allow two people to share a screen through a network. We immediately ran into limitations. The software would crash, it only supported two users, and we needed to adjust the code every time our computer's IP address changed. These types of technical problems usually pop up at the beginning of my projects, but it was already less intimidating having someone else to work on the issues with.</p><p class=\"\">With zero networking experience between the two of us, we went off and researched the different problems, checking in periodically with different solutions that could potentially advance our progress. By sharing the work, we were able to make several breakthroughs on the technical side in a relatively short amount of time. The first breakthrough was learning about and implementing Dynamic DNS on the server-side of our application. This allowed us to use my home computer as the server and not worry about if and when the IP address was going to change, which would break our network. The Dynamic DNS would check for this change and automatically update without requiring us to change our code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829161513-6HDF1VX8L6D2LBA42L8Y/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBf8q6ZLreJt0do1ii7Gszx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYVaBf08eQDdCAwmuFQB60OnPxk7L5R4Ii0kjSaxmF4QpC969RuPXvt2ZwyzUXQf7Q/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.52.00+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2078x1640\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"First Generation Collaborative Drawing Platform\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc328192cf25f69271299\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829161513-6HDF1VX8L6D2LBA42L8Y/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBf8q6ZLreJt0do1ii7Gszx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYVaBf08eQDdCAwmuFQB60OnPxk7L5R4Ii0kjSaxmF4QpC969RuPXvt2ZwyzUXQf7Q/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.52.00+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">First Generation Collaborative Drawing Platform</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">The breakthrough we are most proud of was finding a way to recognize multiple users. We had a theory that if we were already passing the X and Y positions of our mouse back and forth, why not give a new identification number to let the other users know who the information came from? Then we could write code to recognize each user individually as the data went back and forth and add many more users. This may sound simple, but having come up with this solution entirely on our own, with such little programming experience, left us thinking there was very little chance that it would work. It was extremely gratifying to see our homegrown solution expand the demo code we had started with into a truly multiuser interface.</p><p class=\"\">After solving the main technical issues, the collaboration only got stronger. We felt like Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson when we were finally able to get the shared canvas up and running with Dennis drawing from his home in Lowell, Massachusetts, and I, many miles away, drawing from my home in Ashland, Massachusetts. The first drawing came together rather quickly. One of us, I don't remember who, started drawing a horse, the other added a single horn, turning it into a unicorn, and then we both collaborated on a rainbow. The drawing was hideous, but the experience was fantastic. At some point early on, we made a mistake in the code, and there was a line being drawn between the two users, in addition to the lines created by the users mouse. This changed the drawing process quite a bit as it filled up the screen at a much faster rate. It also made some very intriguing shapes. We were pretty sure we understood what was going on, but we invited Dennis's fiancé Krista and my wife Erin to join us, creating a four-person drawing to confirm our assumptions. We all had a great time making strange abstract webs of network lines. After we made the drawing, we combined all four drawings, one from each computer, into Photoshop layers, where we could study the relationship between them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829269912-BB8ITPSJW0FM3P4J3LLA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.53.47+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1640\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 4.53.47 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc38bca0564159dcedbf0\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829269912-BB8ITPSJW0FM3P4J3LLA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.53.47+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Working with Dennis kept this project moving in a fun direction. We both felt like there was something cool about drawing at the same time as someone else, in different locations, on the same canvas. The more people we let use it, the more confident we became that we did not need to justify the purpose of the interface. It was fun and engaging, and every time we came together to work on it we discovered something new.</p><p class=\"\">The drawings we created using the program were genuinely collaborative: often juvenile in their subject matter (robots, unicorns, middle fingers), but always in response to one another. Typically, someone would draw a circle or a box, to which the other users would add a face or body. Psychologist Manfredo Masseroni devised a similar exercise whereby the reader would create a simple scribble and transform it into a bird by simply adding a small circle O and beak &lt; shape. Colin Ware describes how the \"deliberately 'random' scribble is often used by artists and designers as a way of liberating their creative process from stereotyped visual thinking. The perceptual mechanisms are exquisitely tuned to find meaning often from slender evidence, and this is why meaning is so easily found in meaningless scribbles.\" (Ware, 154) Our meaningless scribbles would transform into a variety of characters, sometimes appearing as Santa Claus, an alien, or a portrait of one of the users. Inevitably, someone would start to create a landscape for these characters to live in, drawing a simple line for the ground, stylized trees, or mountains in the distance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829337755-LZCMYQ4QD3L28MI0Y4HO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKs4Q0Rus9ZY-R7rD_OhO297gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0ut9CzaC1EiU9Caf02VbDqmbasFJ7xXkj85GVgh7oWgjgcGyMYcxv6VKA9vw6ehglQ/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.55.07+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1050\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Space Bus, created on our custom collaborative drawing platform written in Processing (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc3d32af054347fde17de\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829337755-LZCMYQ4QD3L28MI0Y4HO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKs4Q0Rus9ZY-R7rD_OhO297gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0ut9CzaC1EiU9Caf02VbDqmbasFJ7xXkj85GVgh7oWgjgcGyMYcxv6VKA9vw6ehglQ/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.55.07+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Space Bus, created on our custom collaborative drawing platform written in Processing (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">As the screen filled up with lines and became more chaotic, the subject matter would also shift toward chaos. Someone would draw weapons for the characters, guns, or axes attacking the other characters on the screen. This aggression would spill over from the battle of the characters on the screen to personal attacks between users. These personal attacks were in the form of someone writing a comment about someone else's mother, or a series of drawings of hands giving the middle finger. In our last semester, we decided that we would continue to work on our collaborative drawing project together, but this time we would bring in even more people to help. Instead of thinking of the people we shared our project with as user testers, we thought of them as coauthors for our project. We would use the project with them and implement the feedback they gave us on the fly.</p><p class=\"\">For example, we created a series of drawings over the network with Scott Murray, a classmate living in San Francisco. As we made our drawings, Scott mentioned that the canvas seemed to ill up too rapidly, making it hard to continue the drawing. He suggested we have the drawing fade over time, and the three of us implemented the code on the spot.</p><p class=\"\">In another session with once classmate and now teacher, Colin Owens, we discussed ways to decrease the delay between user gesture and the image appearing on the screen. Colin wrote a version of the code that helped us speed up the lag making the program closer to real-time. We used Colin's code in combination with some code we worked on with my younger brother Matt, a software engineer by trade. The new code pushed lived on the server-side, further reducing delays and allowing for additional users without having to adjust the code, improving the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829438154-BQO40E6E6OSN1Y9J44YR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLzMRksGQoEBXtSHTQWBw6d7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVKBhsO7QjnnlKpPnym9tD1UsMjgG4xMKRNJ3CQUe_TOJvwGh1qtNWvMhYKnvaKhbA/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.56.39+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1934x1630\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Collaborative drawing created on our custom coded platform (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc439bb6d5e7d704daccc\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829438154-BQO40E6E6OSN1Y9J44YR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLzMRksGQoEBXtSHTQWBw6d7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVKBhsO7QjnnlKpPnym9tD1UsMjgG4xMKRNJ3CQUe_TOJvwGh1qtNWvMhYKnvaKhbA/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.56.39+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Collaborative drawing created on our custom coded platform (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Instead of fearing the feedback of the users, we viewed them as assets to help improve our project.

I am not sure if we will continue to work on this project after graduation, but I am convinced that the experience has changed the way I will work in the future. Working in isolation, guessing at how people will interact, and performing staged user testing was not working for me. Getting together with other creative people and working through ideas together from the beginning is a lot more fun and a much better approach for designing interactive projects.</p><h2>Data&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829522375-27UNIB6EFST6OZKYUOWS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCea0k6vpPYeWvroRTC5v7F7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UeAQZMnlvY5EB26afFMd8xGSnNYzj2BaZr3_kgnrb8vcbSexTd1-frD7527z4SM9QQ/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.58.15+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1936x1632\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Data Visualization of the first 5 seconds of John Coltranes  Giant Steps -  Jason Bailey (2009)\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc48d8818570cab6d80de\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829522375-27UNIB6EFST6OZKYUOWS/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCea0k6vpPYeWvroRTC5v7F7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UeAQZMnlvY5EB26afFMd8xGSnNYzj2BaZr3_kgnrb8vcbSexTd1-frD7527z4SM9QQ/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+4.58.15+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Data Visualization of the first 5 seconds of John Coltranes <em>Giant Steps - </em>Jason Bailey (2009)</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">A week before my first thesis meeting with my advisor, I went on an annual getaway with my father and brothers we call the \"Bailey boy weekend\" camping trip. It was the last weekend before I started my final year at DMI.</p><p class=\"\">After three days of drinking beer and tequila, and incorrectly playing a partial copy of the board game Risk, my brothers, my father, and I sat around the ire to continue the 31-year-plus-long conversation about software, hardware, and technology. As the least technical member of the group, my role in these conversations has generally been as a listener.</p><p class=\"\">Strangely, the conversation shifted to a debate about analog vs. digital, which is something we frequently debate at DMI. But to hear three engineers talk about it made it seem like a different conversation. My father played the role of the defender of all things analog, saying, \"There is no such thing as a unique digital concept.\" My dad claimed anything digital was created in analog format first, and when you convert something from analog to digital, you inevitably lose information in the process. My brothers Matt and Brian, who argue for sport, had a rare surrender, agreeing with this concept of there being no unique digital experience and analog's superiority.</p><p class=\"\">While the unfamiliarity of consensus briefly paralyzed them, I saw a rare window of opportunity to say something without being talked over or shut down. I disagreed with their outcome. I started explaining but couldn't get the ideas in my head to come out of my mouth. Damn you, Jose Cuervo!</p><p class=\"\">Despite the tequila haze that followed me for the next several days, I had locked onto this concept of a unique digital experience. I thought about the projects I had made at DMI. Why were they digital? Just because I was in a digital program at school? More directly, what was I doing with a computer that I couldn't do utilizing analog tools, and why?</p><p class=\"\">I eventually had one of those \"eureka\" moments: most traditional analog media have entirely different inputs and outputs. For example, a saxophone player blows air across a wooden reed (input); outcomes the sound of vibrating air, which we call music (output). This is dramatically different from a film camera in which film is exposed to light and treated with chemicals (input) to create a sequence of images projected in succession (output). Equally different from the two previous examples are drawing and painting, which both employ pigment and a stylus (input) transferred to what is usually a flat surface as a composed static image (output). I decided one of the unique opportunities of digital media is that all traditional media, which had entirely different inputs and outputs, now share a stage of development where they are all data. The result is not a crude approximation of an analog experience but a uniquely digital and entirely new experience.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Drawing With Data</strong></p><p class=\"\">After having the epiphany about reducing all media to a common language of ones and zeros, or \"data,\" I thought back to past projects I had worked on that took advantage of this. One project I created would draw lines in space using frames from live video. A second project I created that summer used object tracking algorithms to create musical compositions from video data taken of different playdough shapes. The user could change the shapes and adjust the sound, or move the shapes left and right to affect the panning. In both of these cases, I was driving one media using the input from another. In the first case, video input was translated into a 3D line drawing output. In the second case, the sculptural form of the Play-dough was recognized and translated through video as an input and then output as sound.</p><p class=\"\">While these projects were already taking advantage of the cross-pollination that is made possible by digital media, I wanted to make several smaller studies with this idea in mind. At the time, I had also been thinking about the role of gesture in drawing. In my programmatic drawings, the physical gesture became irrelevant. The way I pressed the keys on the keyboard did not affect the resulting drawing. I started thinking about the mouse gesture and how I had thought of it more as a limitation for drawing than anything else. I eventually asked myself, Why I was writing off the mouse gesture as irrelevant? After all, I spend more time gesturing with my mouse than I do, making just about any other type of gesture; it's the nature of working with computers. What if I captured the data from the everyday gestures of my mouse and turned them into a drawing? What would it look like?</p><p class=\"\">Normally, I would spend a lot of time trying to write a program to capture my mouse position over time, but I knew I wanted this to be a short, experimental project. So instead, I found some free software that would track the X and Y coordinates of my mouse and save them to a text file. I turned on the mouse tracker and generated thousands of lines of data as I went about my regular computer-related tasks. I tried not to change my behavior as I was interested in capturing the unmodified gestures of my daily mouse-driven activities. I realized pretty quickly that I would have more data than I knew what to do with, so I grabbed a five-minute chunk of the data and put it into a format I could use to import it into Processing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829667460-4FRP0Q9JHVO2THRCGBUG/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kG2LCy1Dw1QYCEofUcI9d3l7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UTi7uikaObkMpiLC9NYXTx3dE_DFS48NzTOCxPJPEpl4JvwGh1qtNWvMhYKnvaKhbA/image-asset.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1938x1628\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Data Visualization of my mouse movements at work.

At first, I thought of this exercise as a data visualization project. I tried to make it clear where the mouse started and stopped by adding circles at these departure points. I lost interest in that approach and started to tweak variables, and add new code to add randomization to the color and location of the lines, testing the drawing each time I made a change. The drawing transformed very quickly from a visualization of my mouse gestures to a more abstract and appealing image. The dense network of colorful lines spanning the screen created a complex dimensional space. Often my goal in creating drawings is not to recreate what I see, but rather to create an entirely new visual space comparable in intricacy to the world around me, less familiar yet still inviting. Initially, it seemed ironic that breaking from the data acquired from actual gestures had made the composition more gestural in its visual qualities. Unlike drawing with a pencil or brush, my programmed drawings relied more on conceptual decisions than physical gestures. My analog drawings required a learned physical dexterity and facility developed over time. That process was different yet strangely similar to drawing with programming.</p><p class=\"\">My analog drawing process, particularly when creating more abstract work, involves making a few marks, stepping back, and evaluating. Often I spend more time assessing than making marks. After that period of contemplation, I usually feel like I know where that next mark belongs.</p><p class=\"\">Frequently when drawing, something outside of my control will happen, an accidental drip of paint, a smudge of charcoal, etc. These elements have become a welcome part of the creative process for me and frequently take the composition in new and interesting directions. When programming drawings, I have a very similar process. I start playing with code, checking in periodically to see what the resulting image looks like. More often than not, I am surprised by what comes on the screen when I run the program. Sometimes I like what I see, and sometimes I don't. One of the great advantages of programming drawings is that my accidents are repeatable. If I tweak the code and like what I see, I can reuse that code in new combinations and turn what was initially an accident into a tool.</p><p class=\"\">After completing the mouse drawing series, I realized I had a tool that could make drawings out of any data with a similar two-column format by mapping the data to the X and Y coordinates and creating lines. Thinking back to my ideas on driving one media with another, I started thinking about using this same code to make drawings out of songs. I knew that the music I played on my computer was just a sequence of numbers at a base level, regardless of whether it was a .mp3 file, a .wav file, or any other audio format. I experimented with different formats trying to find one that would produce data that I could use with my mouse position drawing program. It turned out that exporting music to the ASCII format made precisely the type of data that I needed. The patterns in music would translate to numeric patterns when digitized, which would become visible when processed trough my drawing application. I have always enjoyed John Coltrane's music and decided to use his composition Giant Steps for my experiment with drawing music. I tried to export the entire song into ASCII format and crashed my computer. Realizing that it was just too much data, I cut it in half and crashed my computer again. I proceeded to cut the song into smaller and smaller chunks until I found a manageable piece: the first five seconds. I dropped the data into my drawing program, and a beautiful composition came out.</p><p class=\"\">I knew that five seconds was likely not enough time to establish much of a pattern in the song. Still, it didn't matter to me as I had proved to myself that I could write a song drawing tool by taking advantage of the common language across digital media of ones and zeroes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577829818816-G6MSRCLAVY535H9J4I1T/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kO2o6-S6laFq1ZNvMnJEhlp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UeiSqhFlbJWGY-hbHiC8vIezwejcm8Px1krmuy9j_cwg7zs2yPjc1ECvpa5Zm_kMqw/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.02.36+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1556x1312\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Harmonica Data Visualization.

As a child, I would just wander the stacks, reading the spines, and then extrapolate the theme of any given section.</p><p class=\"\">Because I could not understand the card catalog, it became essential for me to memorize where the good sections were. To this day, I have a pretty crisp image of the two shelves of books that lined the back left corner of the Billerica Public Library. One row deep on the right side and one shelf up from the floor were the children's drawing books. I remember the drawing books sandwiched between other books about juggling, ventriloquism, magic tricks, and karate. I am sure there was some Dewey-type-logic governing this seemingly disparate cluster of books, but to a 6-year-old it was just the \"awesome section.\"</p><p class=\"\">Among this awesome assortment of books, none was more awesome than the drawing books of Ed Emberly. What child could resist books with titles like Make a World and The Drawing Book of Weirdos? The covers of these books were littered with a menagerie of curious, colorful creatures all created from just a few simple shapes.</p><p class=\"\">Although I could not yet read, I was able to intuitively understand the visual instructions, the step-by-step accumulation of simple visual components, combining a line here and a circle there, creating a much larger and more exciting whole. Emberly used slow disclosure, simplicity, and structural transparency to inspire millions of children to draw. The real lesson of Emberly was not in memorizing the specific algorithm of how to draw a witch or dog, but in understanding that you could draw anything, no matter how complex, by disassembling and abstracting it to its fundamental parts.</p><p class=\"\">Like most 6-year-old boys, I was also excited by the idea of superheroes and action figures. In addition to crayons and drawing books, I received G.I Joe and He-Man figures for birthdays and Christmases. These action figures allowed me to stage epic fantasy battles, but I still wanted to generate characters of my own. So I created a team of superheroes called the Wee Wee Men. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I was six, and this seemed like a perfectly proper name at the time.</p><p class=\"\">Initially, there were three Wee Wee Men, each one comprised of two simple overlapping shapes. Think of a square in your mind. Now remove the top line. It should look like a staple. Now duplicate this shape and lip it vertically and move it down slightly. It forms a rectangle with two lines coming off the bottom and two lines protruding from the top. The lines extending from the top were arms, stretched straight up in the air, the lines shooting downward were the legs. In the middle, where the horizontal rectangle formed, I would add two dots for eyes and a crescent for a mouth. The other two Wee Wee Men were of similar construction but used triangles and half-circles.</p><p class=\"\">I eventually realized that by cross-pollinating half-circle with square, square with triangle, etc., I could expand to a much larger cast of characters. I devised an algorithm for drawing superheroes. I spent many hours drawing the scenery with mountains, plains, and rivers, and then populating them with Wee Wee Men societies playing out different situations, usually gory battles where someone would lose a leg or an arm.</p><p class=\"\">Later in life, I made my way into the work world and found little time to create artwork for pleasure. In one of those rare moments where I would create my work for pleasure, I started a series of algorithmic drawings in Maya 3D software. I had taught myself MEL script, the native programming language for Maya Software. The desire to explore how I could apply my new scripting knowledge to create intricate, abstract 3D drawings was consuming me. I would wait until after my wife and I went to bed, get back up, and write 3D drawing algorithms. I was addicted to the surprises of this process. The first surprise would come after I created a simple algorithm and ran the routine. Although driven by math, these drawings were strangely organic, each one a surprise. The second surprise would come after setting up the virtual camera and lights on the model and rendering out the high-quality image. Depending on the complexity of the model, the render could take several hours before finishing. Sometimes the results were stunning. Other times, they were relatively unremarkable, but it was the variety of results and the lack of complete control that made the surprises so rewarding.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Case Study: Player Visualizer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577830127002-A76DV35JYWZFHQXDPQZL/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCgg7PAIJ413pZYxWjOgVH4UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYwL8IeDg6_3B-BRuF4nNrNcQkVuAT7tdErd0wQFEGFSnCwMfhtysQDDmsOkYhtvG-QtLA_Qhm0dZhlHseXjPvjnxrDYj0RV3a3peH5MMFQllA/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.08.18+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x538\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Stat-based data visualization of NBA players.

Even in the shade of the wooden cyber-shack, the heat of St. John in early September was unbearable. I had snuck away from my new bride on our honeymoon to research any off-season trades that may have affected my fantasy basketball draft strategy. The season didn't even start for another month. We had decided to spend the week at a campground tucked into the hills on the shore of a beautiful Virgin Islands beach, and here I was paying a dollar a minute for Internet access to catch up on basketball news. The pleasure I received from basketball statistics eclipsed the joy of watching basketball. This was strange on many levels. Math was responsible for the majority of my scholastic low-points, including failure to place into a credit-bearing course in college despite spending a month in summer school re-taking algebra. This obsession with statistics could only be one thing: sibling rivalry.</p><p class=\"\">Like most siblings, my younger brother and I have always been pretty competitive with each other. Unlike most siblings, our competitions almost always played out in some obscure form: Frisbee golf, eating hot foods, or statistical analysis, for example. We spent a lot of time reading and sharing literature on basketball statistical analysis, including Basketball on Paper by Dean Oliver and Dave Berri's Wages of Wins. Our annual fantasy basketball league was our chance to put our knowledge and theories against one another; it had become an obsession for us both.</p><p class=\"\">Statistics were interesting to me for more than just bragging rights. As a designer creating courtroom graphics for an accident investigation company, I tried to represent complex data in a graphical form that would be intuitive for a jury to understand. This job helped me realize that I enjoyed the process of distilling complex information into simple graphics. That career provided me a never-ending stream of data to work with: crush-data derived from vehicle collisions, thermal maps of building fires, and the fatigue-testing data of microelectromechanical systems, to name a few. But after leaving that job, there was a shortage of new data to visualize. Basketball statistics filled that void for me.</p><p class=\"\">All sports are algorithmic, some more than others. For example, statisticians love baseball because it is arguably the most algorithmic of the more popular sports, making it the easiest to model. Baseball has the longest season, 162 games, which provides a large statistical sample. The action is slow and isolated, making it easy to document. Success and failure are measured in discrete steps based on which base a player gets to: first, second, third, or home. Statistically speaking, basketball represents a much more dynamic space than baseball. It features continuous and decentralized action, making it a challenging sport to document and analyze statistically. So when DMI guest lecturer Peter Kirn asked us to choose a data set to visualize for a summer course in Processing, basketball statistics were the obvious choice.</p><p class=\"\">The first step was to figure out how to import data. I took the information for a single player, in a single game, cleaned it up in Excel, and figured out how to import it into Processing. After tracing the data to the screen, I figured out how to map it to the length of a rectangle, approximating a crude bar graph. I was confident that I understood how the process of importing data worked, but I wanted to make something more interesting than a bar graph. I thought about what my visualization would look like if I stayed with this bar graph approach, but tried to represent every statistical category for each player for the entire previous season. I realized that if I continued on this path, the resulting visualization would be overwhelming and illegible. This is precisely the kind of visualization problem I relish. I started mapping the same data to other shapes: circles, triangles, lines. Then, inspiration struck: I could write an algorithm to draw caricatures of the players using their statistics. It was a similar process to the one I used to illustrate the Wee Wee men superheroes. I could combine simple shapes to develop a wide variety of characters. What made this especially appealing was that many statistics are tied to human physical attributes. For example, a player with great passing ability has good eyes, a rebounder typically is taller with longer legs, shot blockers often have longer arms, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577830217245-TYF0Q62GMJG8K51J1C3K/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMMtd1a5-HP4CdOFvF2imsx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UehpFeyNDoK9awn2bhoTxdR2wOLXERz2_YWi5EE2b5GwoRwB-dUGsSquCnVTFQcaRg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.09.51+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2112x1558\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-31 at 5.09.51 PM.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5e0bc74803dac823b7f33acf\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577830217245-TYF0Q62GMJG8K51J1C3K/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMMtd1a5-HP4CdOFvF2imsx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UehpFeyNDoK9awn2bhoTxdR2wOLXERz2_YWi5EE2b5GwoRwB-dUGsSquCnVTFQcaRg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.09.51+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">This brought on the type of excitement that gets me past the technical challenges of learning a new programming language. I worked feverishly for several nights, perfecting my caricature drawing algorithm for a single player. When I felt like I had a decent likeness of that player, I imported the data for the rest of the 432 players taken from the 82 games played that season and ran the program. I realized, like never before, the power of the computer as a drawing tool. With a few simple code tweaks, I had gone from drawing a single player to drawing 432, and many of them looked like the actual person they represented. More importantly, it was incredibly easy to make quick visual comparisons between the players and even the teams and extract the statistical differences. Instincts provide us with an ability to read the human form incredibly fast and notice subtle differences without difficulty. Although I knew this somewhat instinctively, I confirmed it when my classmate Scott sent me information on Herman Chernoff.</p><p class=\"\">In 1973, Chernoff invented a visualization technique called the \"Chernoff Face,\" which acts on this same basic principle using subtle changes in simple human caricatures to represent large data sets. Drawing just one of these basketball caricatures with statistical accuracy utilizing a pencil or even Adobe Illustrator would have taken me an hour. Now, as if by magic, I had a machine that could generate thousands.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Distribution</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577830271878-2Z4G5MHVK9M6092V8ZDB/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJcsrMRr7XIOKCzMGO8wnLh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UW1p21e7RX013AUWJZW0kG7_ZzMMTnhc7CaWGamHoaEtJvwGh1qtNWvMhYKnvaKhbA/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.10.44+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2072x1642\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Data visualization of all shots taken in the NBA by location and volume.

On May 11th of 2009, Boing Boing Gadget, a sister blog to Boing Boing, published an interactive data visualization I created with my younger brother.</p><p class=\"\">The visualization displayed a 3D bar graph of every shot taken in the NBA for the 2008 season, positioned relative to the location on the court at which the shot was attempted. We had seen a heat map graphic that used color to depict the information in 2D but felt like it did not communicate the discrepancy of shot volume between the locations on a basketball court from which the shot was attempted. (Witus) We decided that a navigable 3D interface could enhance the discrepancies between shots while increasing the clarity of shot location. The visualization had been on my blog for seven months. I had no reason to believe it would be treated any differently than any other post. Typically one or two of my classmates would read my posts and occasionally, my brother, but that was about it. Being the lazy blogger that I am, I did not realize that Boing Boing had picked up my post until several months after I posted the article to my blog.</p><p class=\"\">I was surprised and delighted to find that many other blogs and websites discovered our visualization interesting. There was Alark Joshi, the post-doctoral student from Yale who was doing work on open-source medical imaging and had developed ground-breaking visualizations of hurricane data. Alark posted a large image of our graphic on his \"visualization blog\" with the comment, \"An awesome visualization of all the shots from the NBA 2007-2008 season.\" (Joshi)</p><p class=\"\">AERS, a company specializing in \"advanced transactional data processing,\" was extremely complimentary. They posted the visualization to their website with the title \"Fantastic 3D visualization in Sports\" and finished the article by stating, \"Kudos to Jason… I hope your phone is ringing off the hook with NBA and NHL teams.\" (AERS) No one ever called from the NBA or NHL. But as of January 27, 2010, the AERS reposting of our visualization project had 1,478 views.</p><p class=\"\">Not all the feedback was complimentary. Among the comments on Boing Boing’s original posting were, “It’s a tongue. I can’t be the only one who sees this, “ and, “That image reminds me, very strongly, of the boss fight with Andross in StarFox.” Unbeknownst to us, our project had developed a life of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577830353427-NB23W5OLMHPJWPUI2X87/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.12.07+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1640\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"(Detail) Data visualization of all shots taken in the NBA by location and volume.

This is a uniquely digital phenomenon with little or no analog equivalent. Before working on the computer, like most artists and designers, I would create work, show my friends and family, and every once in awhile, put work in a local gallery where maybe 50 to 100 people would see it. The Internet allowed us to put our work in front of more eyes and inspired more feedback than all my other work combined.</p><p class=\"\">Not to imply that it is simple to get people to care about your work. The visualization had laid dormant on my blog for months before being referenced by a more popular blog, Boing Boing. The Internet, with its 16 billion users, gives anyone with a computer and modem access to an enormous audience. The chances of finding several thousand people who care about basketball visualizations in my everyday life are pretty slim. However, on the Internet, subcultures of people who share my fascinations become a readily available audience.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1577830432628-2I0HDKUI84V2MDQQCBY0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOKRlR9PJqidy1cVMlEfRul7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1Ud7Vlzzt4Yt8ul4Y-jRutMQBxEb3Cc3xIUNzVYBYui2qH3bqxw7fF48mhrq5Ulr0Hg/Screen+Shot+2019-12-31+at+5.13.11+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2084x1640\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Self Portrait, Age 5.

In the past two years, I have given the same advice both times: “get to know your classmates as fast as possible.”</p><p class=\"\">The followup to this \"pearl\" is to \"go out after class with them and drink beer and eat pizza.\" I think this second part is just as crucial as the first, or perhaps it is just the best way I know for people to get comfortable with each other. The DMI faculty have consistently done a great job of choosing an eclectic group of design professionals. The students include architects, filmmakers, ceramicists, writers, usability experts, performance artists, and industrial designers from all around the globe. I made it a point to meet every student that entered the program, learn their name, their background, and invite them out for beer and pizza. I wasn't just nice. I was selfish. Every time I met a new student, I learned something new about design, and I made a new friend.</p><p class=\"\">One of the primary reasons for applying to graduate school for me was the hope that I would become part of a group of creative professionals who would share my interests and help me develop new ones. My biggest regret for my time spent at DMI is not having chosen to work on projects as a group more often. Programming, like drawing, is often an isolated activity. I spent 90 percent of my three years at DMI locked up in my home office, working into the night by myself. There were certainly times where I enjoyed working by myself. drawing and more recently, programming has provided valued \"me time.\"</p><p class=\"\">About halfway through my time in the program, I was working on a project that involved blowing on a balloon tied to a Wii-mote to navigate Google Earth. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this fun for the user. At one point, my wife and I tied 30 helium balloons to our Wii mote and blew it around the backyard with a leaf blower. The balloons carried the Wii mote high up into the air, sailing toward the neighbor's yard and eventually into a tree. Although this approach could be seen as a failure, we had a fantastic time documenting it and trying to get the Wii mote down from the tree. Several months later, I tried to give a live demo with a single balloon carefully placed on a balancing Wii mote such that it would rock back and forth steering through Google earth when the user blew on the balloon. During the end of the semester reviews, I asked everyone to move into the room next door to interact with my demo. When I tried to start my demo, the laptop had fallen asleep, and the demo would not work. Even if the demo had worked, it was not that interesting. It was too predictable, too controlled, too much of a canned experience. The making process was more fun with other people and ultimately more fun than interacting with my final project.</p><p class=\"\">The semester after the failed balloon demo, I took Gunta Kaza's design as an experience class. It was the right timing. Gunta's assignments put more emphasis on the experience, interaction, and collaboration than they did on the artifacts resulting from experience. In one project, we needed to design a solution for characters in conflict from one of several selected stories. I selected an excerpt from The Life of PI detailing several days in the lives of a starving man and a tiger stranded on a raft in the ocean. This seemed like an absurd situation, so I came up with a crazy solution. I decided that it could be a friendly tiger, but the inability to communicate would keep them from realizing they meant each other no harm. I designed a helmet that projected cartoon speech bubbles, allowing them to share in a way that would be clear and non-threatening. I thought I was done with the project, but Gunta asked us to push further. Have solved the immediate crisis, I decided they needed a way to pass the time. Keeping with the absurdist solutions, I decided that Pi and the tiger would write a book of haiku together, which they could then share with the world when they were saved. I had wanted to involve more people in my projects, so I decided to ask my family, friends, and classmates to write a haiku from the perspective of one of the characters. I was surprised by how willing everyone was and how much fun everyone had, and was further inspired to involve others in the creation of future projects.</p><p class=\"\">A few weeks before finishing this thesis book, I had a realization. I had learned many new things at DMI, done a massive amount of research, and developed many new skills, but in the end, I returned to drawing. I thought about the other DMI graduates and realized that most of them had returned to their areas of expertise as well. Whether returning to writing, architecture, music, etc., we almost always come back to our areas of expertise, but with an entirely new viewpoint. I would recommend to future DMI graduates who are struggling as I did to find that big thesis idea to remember where they came from. I think that is where the thesis lives.</p>","contentSnippet":"Real-time Harmonica Visualization, Jason Bailey (2008)\nWhen I graduated with my MFA from the Dynamic Media Institute at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 2010, we were required to design a printed book outlining our projects and our thesis. I thought I had lost the files for my thesis but recently checked with Blurb, where I had it published over a decade ago and was excited to find they still had a copy.\nSome of the ideas in my thesis are a bit cringeworthy ten years on, but it is still the most singular representation of who am I am and how and why I think the way I do as a creative. A lot of Artnome readers know me as a writer, but my thesis focuses on my most active years as a designer and generative artist (2000-2010). It also references the many years I spent before graduate school focused on traditional studio art like painting, printmaking, and sculpture (1990-2000). While it is not a short thesis, I made sure to write it in my voice and to avoid traditional academic-speak. It is more autobiographical than academic, and If you are interested in the creative process and the digital transformation artists and designers have gone through in the last several decades, you might find it a worthwhile read. \nI had told myself I'd publish my thesis on Artnome if I ever had a month where I was too busy to write a new article. This month I have been lucky enough to be writing commissioned pieces for two well-known publications I respect and admire (which I'm psyched to share soon) and did not get a chance to publish anything fresh to Artnome. Not wanting to break an almost three-year streak, I decided it was time to share my master's thesis, ten years on from when I originally finished it. Enjoy!\nDrawing in Code: Pencils, Pixels, Process          \n“We must expect great innovations to transform the entire technique of the arts, thereby affecting artistic invention itself and perhaps even bringing about an amazing change in our very notion of art.”\n Paul Valéry, Pièces sur L’Art, 1931  \nIntroduction\nI have spent my whole life using drawing as a means of understanding and clarifying my environment, synthesizing that understanding, and sharing it with others.\nSometimes drawing has meant trying to accurately recreate what I see around me, such as creating a still life of some interesting objects on a table or a portrait of a family member. This experience provided me an opportunity to examine my world in much closer detail than I otherwise do in daily life.\nIn my day job drawing has also meant taking highly technical information, like the complex physics involved in a car accident, and boiling it down into an easily understood graphic so that others might understand it better; or illustrating statistical data, like the variable temperature in a data center, and turning an overwhelming list of numbers into a clear visual story.\nDrawing has also been about journey and discovery for me, often starting without clearly defined objectives and letting ...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5e096b4374877f00dbe89472","isoDate":"2020-01-01T03:13:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"January 1, 2020","image":""},{"creator":"Jason Bailey","title":"Neural Style Transfer And Inpainting For Artists","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/11/29/neural-style-transfer-and-inpainting-for-artists","pubDate":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 19:59:59 +0000","dc:creator":"Jason Bailey","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1575058067014-R0LPBF2HYC6LSALFD2ME/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMBU_r1tzMd4QwEaiVpd1vh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0hHMyhIh2kKzuOL3ydJCryB1dMAs-2ojG-6zt94yw4AbCPjKOpSfnmOGIuFB5W9LXA/Final_Artnome_Jaws.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1294\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Final_Artnome_Jaws.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5de17a8ee6b0e7013a69b4e4\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1575058067014-R0LPBF2HYC6LSALFD2ME/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMBU_r1tzMd4QwEaiVpd1vh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0hHMyhIh2kKzuOL3ydJCryB1dMAs-2ojG-6zt94yw4AbCPjKOpSfnmOGIuFB5W9LXA/Final_Artnome_Jaws.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">I work for myself and I am cruel boss so I don’t take too much  time off.

I like to mask the seams between images to smooth out the transitions.\nMasking for the content aware fill tool.\nAnd that is basically it!

John’s art, writing, and presentations have shaped my own thinking on art, design, technology, and diversity over the last two decades, and it is a real honor to share our conversation below:</p><p class=\"\">Jason Bailey: Hi John, thanks for writing your new book <em>How to Speak Machine</em> and for the opportunity to ask you some questions about it! As an artist who grew up computationally challenged in a family of engineers (and then worked for two decades in tech in a non-technical capacity), you have been a personal hero of mine for a long time. I believe your new book takes some really important steps in helping people understand the language of computation which is increasingly governing the world we live in despite only a small number of people speaking it with any fluency.</p><p class=\"\">John Maeda: Thanks. I have enjoyed reading your writings and now hearing about your background, it makes sense to me how you mix computational fluency with the arts. It's a rare capability -- but I've noticed that it's slowly increasing. Yes. The book is in reaction to realizing how obscure the computational world really is to someone who never spent a long time immersed in how the machines work. So it's not their fault to be disengaged because the hurdle to really comprehending what's happening in the invisible consciousness of the cloud today is simply hard to believe.</p><p class=\"\">JB: I was pleasantly surprised to see how much space in the book you dedicated to talking about art and design<em>. </em>My first question is about your personal distinction between art and design.<em> </em>I noticed you don’t really spell out a clear differentiation between art and design in the book, but you talk about them very differently. You speak of art and artists with reverence, and I appreciate and share your reverence. A few quotes from the book:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\">Art is the science of enjoying life</p></li><li><p class=\"\">An artist’s perspective keeps you humanly curious</p></li><li><p class=\"\">The earth without art is just eh</p></li><li><p class=\"\">The question inducing power of art&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Artists excel at making unlikely connections all the time&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">As a reader, it feels like you treat art almost like an antidote to a life that can swing too far towards tech.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I have a terrible short-term memory. So as a habit I try to remind myself what is important by writing it down. My hope is that when I come back to it later, I might remember to take it seriously. LOL. The arts are high on my list.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JB: By contrast, you describe the temple of design as being a bit more fickle and commercial, with a handful of superstars dictating new ideas that quickly cycle into and out of fashion.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I would lob a similar criticism about the contemporary arts world, actually.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JB: You also suggest that this model of the sole genius or design star crafting a finished product gets disrupted in a computational world where designs are always in flux, never finished, and informed by continuous feedback from users. The quote that hammered your opinion of traditional design home for me was:</p><p class=\"\">“The standards that elite institutions uphold as the cultural compass for the classical design world are underwritten by subjective decisions and invisible wealth networks that facilitate what gets remembered vs forgotten. The temple of design’s narrative of the genius designer is not a reliable path to success. It’s seductive, but it’s stupid.”</p><p class=\"\">Do you think there is a clear difference between art and design, and, if so, what do you see as the main differences in how they are impacted by an increasingly computational and automated world?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I've always thought of design as making solutions. And art is making questions. Both art and design have access to computation. And so it's possible to make different kinds of solutions and different kinds of questions that were not previously possible.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Will art, like design, shift away from the idea of the sole genius and move toward continuous development and group design, or is the idea of the individual genius too critical to preserving the “question-inducing power of art”?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I think both art and design are grounded in the idea of the lone genius. It's a romantic idea. I lived it for quite a long time. And then I came to realize that teamwork is much more interesting. Should art be created by teams? If the questions to ponder are really big, then yes.</p><p class=\"\">JB: My second question is about artificial intelligence and machine learning. These are hot topics these days, and I think the public has a lot of fear and anxiety based on misinformation they have received from movies and the media about AI/ML being sentient and taking over our jobs.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I agree. And a mood of fear gives the perfect opportunity for politicians and other kinds of leaders to exert power over others with the promise of protecting them. That is concerning to me.</p><p class=\"\">JB: I would have had these same concerns about AI/ML if I hadn’t spent four years at a machine learning startup seeing how difficult it is to get AI/ML to automate even the most basic tasks. So I don’t blame people for being afraid, it seems like there needs to be more education.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I agree. Unfortunately, it's really hard to understand how computation works. It took me many years, just like you. I was wondering if I could make some kind of shortcut. <em>How To Speak Machine</em> is my attempt to do so.</p><p class=\"\">JB: I was thrilled to read your quote from Andrew Ng early in the book, “If you're trying to understand AI's near-term impact, don't think ‘sentience.’ Instead think ‘automation on steroids,’” which aligns with how most experts I know would describe AI/ML.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: That's my favorite quote. I'm glad you liked it, as well.</p><p class=\"\">JB: However, later in the book when talking about exponential advancements, much of the focus is on the singularity. You talk about Vernor Vinge’s prediction of the singularity ending the human era and Ray Kurzweil’s predictions about machines outpacing humans, all of which make people very afraid of AI/ML.</p><p class=\"\">JM: Many technologists don't believe in the singularity. I hesitated to include it in <em>How To Speak Machine</em>. But because the word gets used so often, I wanted to talk about it in the context of how the word started to become used.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Do you think people are right to be afraid of AI/ML?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I think to be afraid of what comes in the future isn't a great way to live. I would reframe it as people should understand what's coming -- which should make them less worried about not knowing what's happened. If you have a general idea of what's happening, you at least have a chance at living with it, or ideally, overcoming it.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Is it a matter of realizing that what we have today is not scary, but it could get scary further down the line?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I think that being scared and more scared is not a good algorithm for life. But if it motivates you to change, and change for the better, then that's a good thing.</p><p class=\"\">JB: You also suggest that when AI does bad things, we humans will be to blame. Does this mean we should be more afraid of humans than of AI?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: The beauty of critical thinking is having the power to ask questions instead of just responding to everything that happens. Being concerned about the humans who are using AI at scale deserves our critical thinking.</p><p class=\"\">JB: How can we help to educate people so they can essentially know the right time to freak out (if ever) and how freaked out they should be?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I am not sure. I thought that it would be good to at least start exposing more people to how computation works. <em>How To Speak Machine</em> is not my first attempt to do so. In 2005 I had an exhibition at the Cartier Foundation called <a href=\"https://maeda.pm/2019/02/28/cartier-foundation-exhibition-2005/\"><em>Nature</em></a> which was seven short animated films I made to depict the universe inside the computer. The fact that nobody knows about them today means that I failed. LOL. So I guess I'll keep trying.</p><p class=\"\">JB: As an extension of the previous question, there is a lot of really interesting art being made using machine learning as a tool which is unfortunately being overshadowed by public discourse fixated around a false narrative of machines replacing artists and making art on their own. As a result, we also have some pretty silly “art” projects with paintbrush-wielding robots wearing wigs grabbing headlines about robots/machines replacing artists.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I enjoy seeing all the work being done out there. Even if it might seem minor, sometimes I think that a bigger outcome can only be understood when we look across all the pieces, no matter how small they might seem.</p><p class=\"\">JB: The advice you give in your book is to “be what AI cannot do.” I believe AI/ML is good for artists because creativity and soft skills will be the hardest to automate, and this will put a premium on skills that artists excel at. What do you think of the art that is being created using machine learning today, for example, using GANs?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I'm excited by it all. I've learned so much by browsing what is being made out there.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Do you think artists should be worried about being replaced by machines, and, if so, when?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I think artists should avoid being worried. Being insecure is fine. But not worried. Otherwise you cannot inspire others.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Or alternatively, do you believe that AI/ML will highlight artists’ unique skills and increase their value?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: My guess is that AI will remove a lot of the nonsense work that we think is important, and allow us to focus on what is truly interesting.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Another aspect of the book that I appreciate is how you tie humanity back to computing. You do this in the book by pointing out that humans were the first computers, that concepts like recursion and fractals can be found in nature, and by pointing out that “computation has a shared ancestor: us.” As we live in an increasingly computationally driven world with inhabitants that do not yet “speak machine,” how can we help put people at ease and feel less disconnected?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: I wish I knew the answer to that. I guess my answer is to continue to think critically about what we do. And to think critically about what I do. If we stay connected to each other, and we can stay connected to ourselves, then we are aware. And present. And then we are no longer disconnected.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Obviously writing a book like yours is a helpful step, but are there other ways we can move in this direction?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JB: I'm glad I wrote the book so I didn't have to think about these things anymore. And now every day I'm just trying to move things in a direction that I believe is important. We can all do that in whatever line of work we are in.</p><p class=\"\">JB: What role, if any, do you think artists can play in helping society to become more comfortable in its own computational skin?</p><p class=\"\">JM: Artists who like to say that computers do not matter can often do so because they are usually independently wealthy enough and do not need to be relevant. For those artists who have less privilege, there's no better time than now to take advantage of a medium that has such potential. So go learn computation deeply.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Last question. In following the arc of your career, I see a theme of wanting to help people better understand computation so that it feels less alien and less intimidating. I see this with <em>Design By Numbers,</em> the programming tool you designed to teach less technical people how programming works, and now, with <em>How to Speak Machine</em>, where you try to explain the basics of programming and computation in words. Do you see this as being one of your life’s missions?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: No. I don't think I ever set out consciously to do whatever I do. I try to be useful in the moment. That moment feels like right now with respect to computation.</p><p class=\"\">JB: What did you hope to accomplish in book format that maybe you could not have achieved with DBN or through teaching and lecturing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">JM: Like everyone, I work to be relevant. Being relevant means being fully open to how whatever you think is right could now be wrong. From a timing perspective, I think that <em>How To Speak Machine</em> is not too early and not too late, and by putting all this thinking in book form, I don't have to teach or lecture about anything. Instead, I can tell someone to simply read the book. And I can go back to work to try to stay relevant by bringing in new thoughts that I don't know yet. LOL.</p><p class=\"\">JB: Thanks again for writing this book, I will be recommending it to folks for a long time!</p><p class=\"\">JM: Wow! Thanks -- that means a lot to me coming from you.</p><p class=\"\"><br></p>","contentSnippet":"I’m thrilled to share that John Maeda, a personal hero of mine, agreed to let me interview him about his new book How to Speak Machine: Computational Thinking For the Rest of Us which, at the time of this interview, has been out just 24 hours.

class=\"\">From October 25, MoMAR returns to MOMA with a smartphone based group show, using Augmented Reality technology. Launched in spring 2018, the non-profit gallery project hijacks the Estée and Joseph Lauder Gallery (former Jackson Pollock Rooms) for the third time. While art seems to be the ultimate place of freedom and individuation, art museums often resemble sacred devotional spaces in which perspectives and behavior know only one direction. MoMAR ties in with the artistic movement of 'Play Art’, which in the 1960s had a democratization of art in mind. Variable art objects made art itself tangible as a product of collective activities and value creation processes. The participants of 'Open to the Public' belong to the generation of the Internet. However, they have also started to dynamize the medium of art, its exhibition forms and ways of interpretation. MoMAR provides a platform for these approaches and therefore rethinks the mechanisms of art curation. Each artist has created new work specifically for the exhibition. Thus 'Open to the Public' takes MoMA's new exhibition concept at its word and provides for 'more than physical expansion'. It is less about the ownership or location of individual works of art than about the plurality and diversity of their experience. The VR-collage “La Barrera” by New York based artist Erin Ko is an augmented reality piece that addresses the signal-to-noise ratio in our everyday lives, at a time when the future seems especially uncertain. Her work plays with the idea that museumgoers are looking at art while the world is burning, melting, and falling apart. But is it simply a luxury, willful distraction, or a genuine appreciation for the present moment? The spatial work “Reef” by German artist Manuel Rosner creates an evolutionary spatial structure that is built by its own dynamics. In contrast to the white cube's neutral architecture it is a colorful mix-up which doesn't derive its aesthetics from expressive forms of art, but from software which uses color-coding for transmitting information. The work “Strokes” by the Japanese artist duo “exonemo” also questions the exhibition space in an abstract way. Each time the piece starts, your phone drips random strokes on the wall and beyond. This ephemeral painting only exists in a world-famous museum, made-up in your mind. Finally, the work “Augmented Selfie” addresses the partly libertarian, partly narcissistic trait of virtual self-representation. An avatar of Akihiko Taniguchi appears in augmented reality and a hand holding an iPhone appears in the first person view in the screen. Tap the screen to take a picture in the AR space and the picture is saved to your smartphone automatically. Akihiko's Avatar will mimic your player’s movements. The artist says: “This is an extended selfie where various things intersect in virtual space and real space, where they meet and gather.” After all, art takes place in the conversations of the exhibition visitors. Let me open Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>About the artists:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The Japanese artist duo <a href=\"http://exonemo.com/\"><strong>exonemo</strong></a> (by SEMBO Kensuke and AKAIWA Yae) was formed in 1996 on the Internet. Their experimental projects are typically humorous and innovative explorations of the paradoxes of digital and analog – computer networked or actual – environments in our lives. Their piece “The Road Movie” won the Golden Nica for Net Vision category at Prix Ars Electronica 2006. Exonemo have been organizing the IDPW gatherings and \"Internet Yami-Ichi\" since 2012. They live and work in New York since 2015.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://erinkostudios.com/\"><strong>Erin Ko</strong></a> is a mixed media artist based in New York. Ko’s experiential art plays with Mediated Reality, Collective Consciousness and Layered Experiences. She combines traditional art making methods with new media tools to address our complicated love/hate relationship with technology. She has worked in video games and new media for 20 years. Some of those endeavors include time spent at Looking Glass Studios, Razorfish, and Blue Fang Games.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.manuelrossner.de/\"><strong>Manuel Rossner</strong></a> creates spaces that merge playfulness, sobriety and abstract aesthetics. Often, but not necessarily, they intersect with reality. His work has been shown in international institutions and galleries. After founding Float Gallery in 2012, he designed a digital extension building for NRW-Forum Düsseldorf and a virtual building for Roehrs &amp; Boetsch Gallery in Zürich. His solo exhibition for the Museum der bildendenden Künste Leipzig opens in autumn 2019. He lives and works in Berlin.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://okikata.org/\">https://okikata.org/</a> lives and works in Japan. His work includes installations, performances and video works using self-built devices as well as software. In recent years, he has focused on net art work – and sometimes VJing. Tanoguchi teaches at Tama Art University and Musashino Art University. Main exhibitions include \"dangling media\" (\"emergencies! 004\" at \"Open Space 2007,\" ICC, Tokyo, 2007), \"Space of Imperception\" (Radiator Festival, UK, 2009), \"redundant web\" (Internet, 2010) \"[Internet Art Future?]\" (ICC, Tokyo, 2012).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>The gallery</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">MoMAR is an unauthorized gallery concept aimed at democratizing physical exhibition spaces, museums, and the curation of art within them. MoMAR is non-profit, non-owned, and exists in the absence of any privatized structures. MoMAR uses Augmented Reality to overlay art onto existing artwork and frames housed in museums and gallery spaces around the world. Downloading the MoMAR app, visitors hold their phones over specified frames and spaces in order to view alternate artwork, and MoMAR exhibits.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Download the MoMAR app at http://momar.gallery Alternatively, iOS 11 users, simply point your camera at the code for instant download. You cannot view the exhibit without the app. Unless you have psychic powers.

MoMA can spend $450 million on renovations, but no amount of money can keep savvy artists groups like MoMAR from subverting the museum from a place designed for the public consumption of art into to a space for the public display of art. \nA recent study shows that over 75% of art in US museums is by white men. A second study shows that without having work in the MoMA and a handful of other institutions, artists have little to no chance of achieving great success.   Until the system changes, the fastest route to diversifying museums and gaining recognition may be to beg forgiveness rather than seek permission and to follow the lead of MoMAR.\nIn support of the exhibition and in solidarity with our friends at MoMAR, we are sharing their full press release, as well as several GIFs from the exhibition below. \nErin Ko LA BARRERA\nManuel Rossner-REEF\nexonemo STROKES\nAkihiko Taniguchi AUGMENTED SELFIE\nOfficial Release from MoMAR\nNEW YORK, October 25, 2019— \nFrom October 25, MoMAR returns to MOMA with a smartphone based group show, using Augmented Reality technology.

Specifically, I have been thinking about the language of computing as an increasingly dominant and universal language which shapes all aspects of our lives despite only a small percentage of our population (developers and computer scientists) having any real fluency in it. </p><p class=\"\">People with limited exposure to programming and training networks often assume creating generative art is a carefully planned, predictable, and linear process with a predetermined outcome, but nothing could be further from the truth. A common thread across the artists in this exhibition is a circuitous path of discovery, an addiction to surprise, and an ability to embrace and build on “accidents” or the unexpected. </p><p class=\"\">There is, of course, no one “right” way to conceive of these surprises and the role that technology plays in the generative artmaking process.  Some see code and networks as a just another tool. Others describe it as more of a creative collaborator. That each artist in this show has their own way of describing how technology augments their own creativity only serves to further individuate their work and brings a richness to the dialogue surrounding the exhibition.   </p><p class=\"\">Among artists, generative artists carry a unique burden of having to explain how programming and machine learning work without distracting their audience from their other artistic ambitions. Without at least some insight into computing and code, we as an audience cannot fully appreciate their artistry and craft. </p><p class=\"\">The most engaging generative artists share the ability to seamlessly educate us on how their work is created and use that opportunity to reinforce their artistic objectives rather than to distract from them.  </p><p class=\"\">In his <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/channels/140654/18907070\">2010 presentation at the Flash on the Beach</a> conference, <a href=\"http://www.complexification.net/gallery/\">Jared Tarbell</a> does a masterful job of using his artwork as an aid in explaining programming concepts. Tarbell starts by sharing his love of nature, something we can all relate to. He then explains how iterating or “looping” a simple command to create dots can empower us to recreate the same complex and beautiful patterns found in nature. He then uses the simple algorithm behind his famous 2003 work <em>Substrate </em>(which we are excited to feature in our exhibition)<em> </em>as an example.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1571658949018-JYUEN67T2K9U60Y7GHBN/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNFqGVKZllalnDj8dMqiZQdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIWCxQFK3hfGNj2ZyMWSdR9mjTwSwMOS9lQPyMuuGODqYKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/Jared_Tarbel.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"780x580\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jared Tarbell,  Substrate  - 2003\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5dad9cc4bcfe0c53d06be7b6\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1571658949018-JYUEN67T2K9U60Y7GHBN/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNFqGVKZllalnDj8dMqiZQdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIWCxQFK3hfGNj2ZyMWSdR9mjTwSwMOS9lQPyMuuGODqYKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/Jared_Tarbel.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Jared Tarbell, <em>Substrate </em>- 2003</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">As Tarbell describes it: </p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Let’s imagine in this system that we create a line and we allow this line to draw. The line will continue to draw until it hits the edge of the screen or another line and then it stops and then two new lines form. New lines will also only form at right angles to existing lines. So those are the rules. But if we repeat this process over and over again, something amazing happens, so I am just going to let this go.   </p></blockquote><p class=\"\">The construction of Tarbell’s <em>Substrate</em> mirrors that of his presentation in that it builds on very simple definitions and actions to create something complex, rewarding, and beautiful. The fact that Tarbell shows us how his work is made does not detract from it. Instead, understanding Tarbell’s process only increases our curiosity and engagement.  </p><p class=\"\">Tarbell originally created <em>Substrate</em> back in 2003 using a programming language specifically designed for creatives called Processing. <a href=\"http://reas.com/\">Casey Reas</a> and <a href=\"https://benfry.com/\">Ben Fry</a>, co-creators of <a href=\"https://processing.org/\">Processing</a>, wanted to create a language and a community that could make it easier for creatives to explore programming as a tool for making art. </p><p class=\"\">The Processing language has been a huge success and has empowered hundreds of thousands of creatives by reducing the learning curve to use programming as an artmaking tool. </p><p class=\"\">We are honored to be featuring Reas’ 2004 <em>MicroImage</em> in the exhibition. As with Tarbell’s <em>Substrate</em>, Reas’ <em>MicroImage</em> is a complex system constructed from the repetition of relatively simple parts and commands. By creating thousands of dots and programming them each with a simple set of behaviors designed to react to their surroundings, Reas explores the concept of emergence within a software environment. </p><p class=\"\">MicroImage (Software 1), 2002/2014. Software, 1920 x 1080 pixels.</p><hr /><p class=\"\">The dots follow simple rules, and there is no central system instructing how each individual dot should behave. Local interactions between the dots leads to the emergence of a type of swarm intelligence, a global behavior, which the individual dots could not exhibit on their own.</p><p class=\"\">The results as seen in Reas <em>MicroImage </em>are breathtaking and feel like like a living, breathing, pen-and-ink drawing undulating with rythyms reminiscent of schools of fish or flocks of birds.</p><p class=\"\">Reas shares his process: </p><blockquote><p class=\"\">The core of the “<em>MicroImage”</em> software was written in one day. The current version of the software has developed through a gradual evolution. While the base algorithm controlling the movement was constructed in a rational way, subsequent developments were the result of aesthetic judgments constructed through many months of interacting with the software. Through directly manipulating the code, hundreds of quick iterations were created, and changes were implemented based on analyzing the responsive structures. This process was more similar to intuitive sketching than rational calculation.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\"><em>Substrate</em> and <em>MicroImage</em> feel natural because they harness concepts and algorithms found in nature, but in the hands of generative artists like Tarbell and Reas, these algorithms create new worlds rather than replicate the one we live in. Part of what is new and powerful about generative art is the ability to go beyond painting an illusionistic image of nature and to actually create systems that emulate the creative forces of nature itself. </p><p class=\"\">If programming can better help us understand the complexities of nature by harnessing hidden algorithms for the creation of art, could it also help us understand the complexities of our own minds and the minds of machines?</p><p class=\"\">Artist <a href=\"http://www.triplecode.com/\">David Young</a> explores the similarities and differences between human and machine learning by training models with a severely limited data set. While most still consider art made with AI and ML to be “generative art,” the process is a significant departure from traditional methods used with tools like Processing. Young explains in his essay <em>Tabla Rasa: Rethinking the Intelligence of Machine Minds</em> :</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Like AI programmers, artists working with AI don’t encode rules, but instead train networks. The resulting artworks look and feel different from previous forms of computer-based art for they reflect the organic messiness of their vast and inscrutable neural networks.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">In an attempt to better understand machine intelligence, Young takes an empirical approach to training GANs (generative adversarial networks), observing closely as he sparingly adds new training data. By severely limiting the quantity of training data used for the model, Young hopes to better understand how AI builds an understanding of the natural world. </p><p class=\"\">David Young, Still from Tabula Rasa (b67o,2600,2) animation - 2019</p><p class=\"\">Our exhibition, <em>Augmenting Human Creativity</em>, features Young’s documentary animation Tabula Rasa (b67o,2600,2)  which chronicles the learning process of his GAN. Watching Young’s model learn in compressed time is fascinating, but it raises more questions than it answers. Among the key questions prompted for Young were: </p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Do we need to develop a new concept of beauty to evaluate what emerges from working with these systems? And is it possible that a new aesthetic can give us a better, more empowered understanding of AI? </p></blockquote><p class=\"\">Young argues that all training data includes the emotional bias and irrationality of the human who selected it. This leads him to ask: </p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Given that we can’t help but use human terms to describe the behavior of AI systems — we say that the machine is “learning,” it “knows” something, it has “skills,” the word “intelligence” is inescapable — perhaps we should look for other human traits. Might machine “emotions” be a new way for us to approach and understand AI?</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">Whether we think of AI as an emotional entity or simply accept that the data it is trained on is imbued with the emotions and bias of the human who curated it, it is interesting to explore how it can interpret or even contribute to complex cultural concepts like fashion and costume. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1570558836908-83JOYXTUSA95FKLBY4UY/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPgibOTtwA_Im0eN1aLGlf57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UX25jOUFwReuTCyObThUFfcohkSd-ZySVT76l-w-_odZMW9u6oXQZQicHHG1WEE6fg/Screen+Shot+2019-10-08+at+2.02.09+PM.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1782x1164\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Harshit Agrawal,  Masked Reality  - 2018\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d9ce44cbcb0124b05f84720\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1570558836908-83JOYXTUSA95FKLBY4UY/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kPgibOTtwA_Im0eN1aLGlf57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UX25jOUFwReuTCyObThUFfcohkSd-ZySVT76l-w-_odZMW9u6oXQZQicHHG1WEE6fg/Screen+Shot+2019-10-08+at+2.02.09+PM.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Harshit Agrawal, <em>Masked Reality </em>- 2018</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Artist <a href=\"http://harshitagrawal.com/\">Harshit Agrawal</a> creates artificial intelligence/machine learning-generated faces, drawing inspiration from traditional mask cultures of different regions of India.

Chung is best known for her project <em>Drawing Operations</em> in which she engages in a drawing performance with a robotic arm. Chung explains, “The interface is not simply a mediating apparatus for creation, but a speculative agent of co-creation.” </p><p class=\"\">Drawing Operations (Duet) is a performance centered on a drawing collaboration between human and machine. In this duet, Sougwen and Drawing Operations Units: Generation 1&amp;2 create an improvised drawing corresponding to 3 themes, tracing a narrative of human and machine; Mimicry, Memory and Future Speculations. Each thematic chapter showcases an evolving robotic behavior linked to the artists explorations into art &amp; Ai. The 25 minute performance is accompanied by a visual projection and an original score by Aquarian. The work is part of an ongoing series of Drawing Operations projects by Sougwen Chung.</p><p class=\"\">Like Agrawal, Chung is comfortable mixing technology with tradition. In a recent interview, Chung explains:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">I don’t see tradition and technology as oppositional or mutually exclusive. I utilize the technology of tradition, and are we not growing into a tradition of technology? Insofar as we can frame a narrative around tradition as that which is made by hand and technology as that which is made by machine, the work I’m doing is certainly an exploration of the possibilities in the intersection of both… one that is gaining clarity the further along I go.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">In addition to robotics and neural networks, Chung’s work uses a variety of traditional art materials as well as digital tools including, but not limited to, Photoshop, Illustrator, Cinema4d, Processing, nano-controllers, electric violin, Wacom tablet, Arduino, projectors, and Madmapper.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1570560335594-H444HWJJ2GKBL5ET5TWH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCPztTQZpDiZMOuuCfUxiyx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYlQ-m0oNUh_9buvyC-f1CSdhG_dNlqULB2ZTz-ses64A-QPhXXvNcU0N8wN7BGx0g/sougwen-2017_limitless_01.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1600x1200\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Sougwen Chung,  The Limitless, The Absolute  -2017\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d9ce44cbcb0124b05f84726\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1570560335594-H444HWJJ2GKBL5ET5TWH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCPztTQZpDiZMOuuCfUxiyx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UYlQ-m0oNUh_9buvyC-f1CSdhG_dNlqULB2ZTz-ses64A-QPhXXvNcU0N8wN7BGx0g/sougwen-2017_limitless_01.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Sougwen Chung, <em>The Limitless, The Absolute</em> -2017</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>Augmenting Creativity</em> will feature Chung’s work <em>The Limitless, The Absolute</em> which she released alongside the Lunar Calendar for 2017. </p><p class=\"\">According to Chung:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\"><em>“The Limitless, The Absolute”</em> is an artistic interpretation of the Bagua฀八卦; the eight Taoist trigrams that represent the principles of reality as organic, emotive, and experiential environments. The correspondences between the eight interlocking concepts of the Bagua are used in Taoist cosmology to interpret and contemplate reality and existence. The patterns formed as the trigrams interrelate provide the conceptual logics used by the artist to create delicate, complex, shifting environments resembling ecosystems.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">Like Chung, artist and roboticist <a href=\"https://areben.com/\">Alexander Reben</a> is fascinated with the relationship between humans and machines. Reben’s work deals with synthetic psychology, artificial philosophy, and robot ethics to “probe the inherently human nature of the artificial.” </p><p class=\"\">New technologies can often feel foreign and distant from our human nature, frequently leading to irrational fear and anxiety. Reben’s work explores and often collapses this distance by exploring the relationships between humans and machines on a more visceral and intimate scale. </p><p class=\"\">Issac Asimov’s first rule of robotics is “do no harm.” Breaking this rule, Reben developed a robotic arm with a lancet that was capable of detecting a human presence administering a needle prick to the intruder. </p><p class=\"\">The first robot to autonomously and intentionally break Asimov's first law, which states: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

For the project, Reben built a photo booth and created an average portrait of over 700 of the attendees to the fair using machine learning and GANs. </p><p class=\"\">Combinations of real faces in the latent space from over 700 people who visited the art installation at Ars Electrionica. (real people as represented by an AI, styleGAN)</p><p class=\"\">Reben notes when people become active participants and see themselves as part of the project it, personalizes and transforms their relationship to the technology in was that simply seeing a tech demo of GANs does not.  </p><p class=\"\">We are excited to be including a variation of <em>Latent Faces</em> as part of the <em>Augmenting Creativity</em> show. The photos of visitors to the show in Nanjing will be processed by Reben in batches locally in San Fransisco to create a face of the average attendee in Nanjing.  </p><p class=\"\">It is an honor to continue to curate exhibitions of generative art around the world. I am extremely grateful to both Nanjing University for hosting the exhibition and to the many artists for their generosity in working with me to put together the show. The exhibition is open to the public, so if you find yourself near Nanjing, please do stop in.</p><h2><strong>Epilogue - Professor CJ Chen</strong></h2><p class=\"\"><br>“What’s beautiful is difficult,” as Plato said. Understanding art is also difficult&nbsp; now -- especially digital art. We all kind of agree that everyone is an artist in the digital era due to the convenience of digital tools. However, we also know that not everyone can understand the complexities of writing computer code, which is an important part of understanding digital art.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Accordingly, it causes difficulties for the audience to appreciate the artworks made by/with digital technology. It may not bother some artists, who feel the audience does not need to understand the code and programming behind the interface before they see the works, but it does bother researchers like me.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">We study art as well as digital technology. We are creating/imagining an ecological environment where artists, audiences, and machines -- including hardware and software -- can understand and communicate with each other. Because some of us believe that the future will be built by humans and machines together, we want to know and better understand the technology better from the beginning as part of the process of appreciating the art.</p><p class=\"\">Making art could be the most creative and innovative way to help human beings talk about and understand artificial intelligence and machine learning. Understanding these technologies is important because it impacts the future of all humans, no matter where you are. That’s a reason why I, a researcher on digital media and humanities at Nanjing University, China, invited Jason Bailey, a critic and curator on digital art in the US, to hold this exhibition in China.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Jason and I share the common belief that artists (and curators) can play a critical role in helping audiences to understand the new technologies shaping our world. As Jason says:&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>Programming is an increasingly dominant and universal language which shapes all aspects of our lives despite only a small percentage of our population (developers and computer scientists) having any real fluency in it.</em></p><p class=\"\">Fear comes from ignorance. We hope everyone will enjoy and appreciate the works as well as the beauty of the collaboration between artists and technology, human, and machine. </p><p class=\"\">- CJ Chen</p>","contentSnippet":"Casey Reas, Still from Microimage (Software 1) - 2002/2014\nI am thrilled and honored to announce that Artnome will be curating an exhibition titled Augmenting Creativity - Decoding AI and Generative Art at Nanjing University this November, 2019. \nIn preparing an exhibition in a country I have never been to and whose language I do not speak, I’ve been thinking a lot about translation and communication. Specifically, I have been thinking about the language of computing as an increasingly dominant and universal language which shapes all aspects of our lives despite only a small percentage of our population (developers and computer scientists) having any real fluency in it. \nPeople with limited exposure to programming and training networks often assume creating generative art is a carefully planned, predictable, and linear process with a predetermined outcome, but nothing could be further from the truth. A common thread across the artists in this exhibition is a circuitous path of discovery, an addiction to surprise, and an ability to embrace and build on “accidents” or the unexpected. \nThere is, of course, no one “right” way to conceive of these surprises and the role that technology plays in the generative artmaking process.  Some see code and networks as a just another tool. Others describe it as more of a creative collaborator. That each artist in this show has their own way of describing how technology augments their own creativity only serves to further individuate their work and brings a richness to the dialogue surrounding the exhibition.   \nAmong artists, generative artists carry a unique burden of having to explain how programming and machine learning work without distracting their audience from their other artistic ambitions. Without at least some insight into computing and code, we as an audience cannot fully appreciate their artistry and craft. \nThe most engaging generative artists share the ability to seamlessly educate us on how their work is created and use that opportunity to reinforce their artistic objectives rather than to distract from them.  \nIn his 2010 presentation at the Flash on the Beach conference, Jared Tarbell does a masterful job of using his artwork as an aid in explaining programming concepts. Tarbell starts by sharing his love of nature, something we can all relate to. He then explains how iterating or “looping” a simple command to create dots can empower us to recreate the same complex and beautiful patterns found in nature. He then uses the simple algorithm behind his famous 2003 work Substrate (which we are excited to feature in our exhibition) as an example.\nJared Tarbell, Substrate - 2003\nAs Tarbell describes it: \n\nLet’s imagine in this system that we create a line and we allow this line to draw. The line will continue to draw until it hits the edge of the screen or another line and then it stops and then two new lines form. New lines will also only form at right angles to existing lines. So those are the rules....","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5d9ce44cbcb0124b05f84728","isoDate":"2019-10-21T19:32:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"October 21, 2019","image":""},{"creator":"Christina Cacouris","title":"An Interview With Art Forger Robert J.C.

Driessen than I do with most blue chip art collectors: We both grew up dreaming of being artists, and we were both deeply disappointed to discover the art world is not designed to support most artists and often feels rigged (<a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2018/12/03/moneyball-art-world/\"><span>data suggests</span></a> this is not just a “feeling”).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Anecdotally, I spent much of my life in art school and in art classes surrounded by artists. Despite this, I have met only one person who makes a full-time living off of their art, and he is a political cartoonist. </p><p class=\"\">So I can see how Driessen could easily have become disillusioned and desperate as a young artist and started justifying forgery as an act of revenge against a system that failed to recognize his own talents. It’s likely Driessen thought forgery was a crime that only impacted a tiny percent of very wealthy collectors and institutions. The problem is, this isn’t true. Forgery impacts us all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1569100849092-12HFOVQ7DHWZ6P5IT6HQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kD3Ive3MP4y0XK6x_f3n61NZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpzwqv4nRkGP6VrzxDVxtOscY_B9m9AmX62vybmd0K8g5TyDAMteSB9aZVI3AAX8bNY/2529081768.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"670x376\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Cache of Giacometti forgeries\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d869430b41b640ba534d112\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1569100849092-12HFOVQ7DHWZ6P5IT6HQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kD3Ive3MP4y0XK6x_f3n61NZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpzwqv4nRkGP6VrzxDVxtOscY_B9m9AmX62vybmd0K8g5TyDAMteSB9aZVI3AAX8bNY/2529081768.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://hoolawhoop.blogspot.com/2013/05/anyone-who-believes-he-can-buy-real.html\">Cache of Giacometti forgeries</a></p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">In <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2017/10/28/an-open-letter-to-art-forgers\">an open letter to art forgers</a> I wrote back in October of 2017, which mentioned Driessen by name, I pleaded with forgers to stop thinking of their actions as victimless crimes. I reminded them that it is the would-be artists, the modern versions of their younger selves, who are the ones who miss out as a result of their forgeries. The damage is not merely mistaking their works for those of other artists, but the cumulative erosion of a credible artistic record of our most important cultural objects: our art.</p><p class=\"\">To his credit, Driessen responded to my open letter to forgers to open up a dialog. From Driessen:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">By coincidence I read your “OPEN LETTER” to Art Forgers, now one year ago.</p><p class=\"\">My name is Robert JC Driessen and I forged “Giacometti” sculptures and many other artists I admired.</p><p class=\"\">The fact I forged was that I was not bright minded enough to create something myself.<br><br>That is why I always tell people, “I am not an artist but I make art”…</p><p class=\"\">…I did try, (after my prison sentence) to make my own art but the public does not seem to like it very much.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">But please do not worry, I will not forge “ART” any more.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">I am very happy that Driessen no longer creates forgeries, and I hope other forgers follow his good example. But we need to stop celebrating forgery in popular culture as “a few rascals getting one over on the rich and powerful” and call it out for the irreparable damage it does to our shared cultural history. That said, I don’t believe anyone, even forgers, are all good or all bad. I believe everyone can change, and I believe that people deserve second chances. I also believe that if you see something as a problem (forgers and forgery in this case), it is better to engage with the problem and try to understand it than it is to ignore it and hope it goes away on its own.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In the spirit of better understanding forgers, I’d meant to interview Robert Driessen since he reached out to me almost a year ago. I had not found the time and did not trust anyone else to do the interview. Then journalist and art historian Christina Cacouris reached out to volunteer to help with Artnome. Cacouris was willing to help with the less-exciting aspects of Artnome, including cleaning data. But when I read her writing and, particularly, her interviews, I thought data cleaning would be a waste of her talents. So I  asked if she’d be interested in interviewing Driessen for Artnome.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Cacouris obliged, and she did an excellent job with a tricky interview. She avoids the trap of lionizing or villainizing Driessen, and instead tries to understand him and his motivations. Much of what Driessen chooses to share with Cacouris has more to do with attacking the art world rather than with his own history as a forger. I must say this blame feels misplaced for me. If Driessen and other forgers had not produced the forgeries in the first place, there would be no concern with the work entering into the marketplace (and later, into our museums). </p><p class=\"\">I also don’t believe any auction house would make it a regular practice to undermine public trust in their own brand, as trust — not art — is their stock and trade. With hundreds of years in operation as trusted brands, Christie’s and Sotheby’s have outlasted most brands from most other industries.  Businesses do not achieve that type of prolonged success by trading long-term trust for a quick buck in the short run.</p><p class=\"\">While I disagree with Driessen’s assessment, I appreciate him sharing his perspective with Cacouris so that we might better understand some of the motivations behind forgers and forgery moving forward. I am also delighted to welcome Cacouris as a contributor to Artnome, and I encourage you to <a href=\"http://www.christinacacouris.com/\">read her other work</a>, as it is excellent. </p><h2>An Interview With Art Forger Robert J.C.

Perhaps it’s because the art world has been so overinflated that when we hear about the Leonardo da Vinci selling to a Saudi prince for $450 million and then have it turn out to be most likely fake, we respond with glee. There’s something of a Robin Hood complex about it all: Only the ultra-rich are being swindled, so what’s really the harm?</p><p class=\"\">“It’s absolutely not da Vinci,” says Robert Driessen of that spectacular auction. A former art forger, he says he can spot fakes a mile away. “Have you seen the before restoration and after restoration? It’s a totally different painting now. It’s unbelievable how people can fall for that.”</p><p class=\"\">By his own estimate, Driessen created thousands of forgeries during his run as a forger in Europe, starting with oil paintings, then moving to sculpture. He sold these works to collectors, who, knowing they were fake, would then take the pieces to auction. At the apex of his forging career, he focused his production on Giacometti sculptures, before his arrest in July 2014. He spent a few years in prison, then relocated to Thailand, where he still makes Giacometti reproductions—with the disclaimer that they are not originals.</p><p class=\"\">Driessen called me from Thailand to discuss his life’s work and perspective on forging. From our interview and from his self-published memoir, it’s clear that Driessen intended to be an artist himself, but fell into forging when he desperately needed money and received a commission to paint 19th century Romantic-style Dutch and German landscapes that weren’t <em>exactly</em> meant to be forgeries, per se, but also weren’t exactly meant to be anything else.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">He wavers between remorse for his wrongdoing and denouncing the art world as essentially being no better, therefore justifying his work. “I really mean it from the bottom of my heart: I love art, I dream art, I eat art,” he says. “But the art world is so loathsome you wouldn’t believe.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">There’s an obvious incentive for auction houses to inflate the value of a work, which can be done in a variety of ways, from accepting something widely believed to be fake (see: <em>Salvador Mundi</em>), to price fixing (see: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/31/arts.artsnews\">Christie’s and Sotheby’s</a> ). The house always wins, and even the littlest white lies can begin to stack up.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">“They take a glance at where it comes from, and as long as they can sell it, they <em>need</em> art to sell,” he says. “As long as it looks good and they’ve got some reference, they don’t really care where it’s from.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">“I think that 30-40% of all the auction houses is forged art,” he adds.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The normal process for selling work from a private collection at auction involves having the work authenticated by a third party expert; the collector then takes their work and the authentication certificate to an auction house, like Christie’s or Sotheby’s, who then sets a starting price and brings it to auction. Intentionally or not, there’s a lot of room for error in the authentication process.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Not every work by an artist has been documented, and artists often change styles throughout their career. There is rarely one singular marker that will clearly separate the fakes from the originals. It’s almost impossible to be certain, so, claims Driessen, most authenticators give objects the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Would a database like Artnome’s compiling the top 40 artists’ known works help combat incorrectly authenticated forgeries? “Yeah, but I don’t think it’s possible,” he says. “Artists, if you’re talking about the top 40, you’re talking about Picasso, Giacometti, Cezanne. These people hardly ever held records, and you still find in attics or basements some piece which is not registered. Of course most of them are fakes, but sometimes a good piece turns up. The problem also is, if it is an original piece and you go to an expert, the expert will not want to burn his hand and say, ‘No, I don’t think it’s original.’ That also happens.”</p><p class=\"\">But, authenticators can be persuaded to give something the benefit of the doubt: “If a piece is good, if a piece is almost original, I do know from experience that if you say to an expert, ‘If you say it’s original, and I put it in the auction, and for the selling price, I’ll give you 20%, 30%, 40%’ — if it’s a piece that brings $10 million, come on! It’s a million [dollars] just for the expert to say ‘yes’.”</p><p class=\"\">There’s also a built-in protection for the expert, should things go awry and the piece is discovered to be a fake: “They say, ‘Well, I can’t know everything. To the best of my ability, I thought it was genuine.’ That also happens.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The line between real and fake, authentic and inauthentic, can also be tenuous when looking at sculptures that are made from casts. Take Rodin, who willed his estate to the Nation of France in 1916, which authorized the government to make posthumous casts. There are some provisions; the date of the cast has to be inscribed on each sculpture, to delineate between those that were made by Rodin’s hand (or, if not by his hand precisely, at least made during his lifetime) and those that are being cast posthumously.</p><p class=\"\">Every cast that the government makes of Rodin’s sculptures is, technically, a Rodin sculpture. What, then, separates that from the works by Driessen or other forgers who used casts they took from the original sources — are they any less authentic than a government-cast Rodin?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In his memoir, Driessen talks about the prevalence of family members creating posthumous casts to make more money after an artist’s death, citing the German sculpture Wilhelm Lehmbruck as one example, with his widow casting many more pieces from his original molds. “I made Lehmbruck, as well,” he says, “but his wife did the aftercasts, and she wouldn’t let anybody be involved because she wanted all the money. Everything that she knew wasn’t made by her, she called fake.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">“It is of course an extension of the original,” he adds. “But people don’t call it that way. They say no, there’s only five works, and now suddenly there’s 15 or 150; it’s still the same thing, but you can’t call it original anymore. But it’s still the same sculpture.”</p><p class=\"\">I mention how this inflation ultimately lessens the value, which affects both the artists and their families and all of their patrons; I ask if he’s ever had ethical qualms about his practice as a forger and how it can affect others in this way. “Not whatsoever, actually. I never went to an auction house myself,” he says. “I sold it to people who were interested, and they knew what I was doing, but I never made the big money. I sold it for little money, and that’s how I lived my life. I was just making art.”</p><p class=\"\">He catches himself. “Not making art. I was copying art. I’m not an artist.”</p>","contentSnippet":"Sculpture in the style of Alberto Giocometti, created and signed by Robert J.C. Driessen\nForeword by Jason Bailey\nI probably have more in common with notorious art forger Robert J.C. Driessen than I do with most blue chip art collectors: We both grew up dreaming of being artists, and we were both deeply disappointed to discover the art world is not designed to support most artists and often feels rigged (data suggests this is not just a “feeling”). \nAnecdotally, I spent much of my life in art school and in art classes surrounded by artists. Despite this, I have met only one person who makes a full-time living off of their art, and he is a political cartoonist. \nSo I can see how Driessen could easily have become disillusioned and desperate as a young artist and started justifying forgery as an act of revenge against a system that failed to recognize his own talents. It’s likely Driessen thought forgery was a crime that only impacted a tiny percent of very wealthy collectors and institutions. The problem is, this isn’t true. Forgery impacts us all.\nCache of Giacometti forgeries\nIn an open letter to art forgers I wrote back in October of 2017, which mentioned Driessen by name, I pleaded with forgers to stop thinking of their actions as victimless crimes. I reminded them that it is the would-be artists, the modern versions of their younger selves, who are the ones who miss out as a result of their forgeries. The damage is not merely mistaking their works for those of other artists, but the cumulative erosion of a credible artistic record of our most important cultural objects: our art.\nTo his credit, Driessen responded to my open letter to forgers to open up a dialog. From Driessen:\n\nBy coincidence I read your “OPEN LETTER” to Art Forgers, now one year ago.\nMy name is Robert JC Driessen and I forged “Giacometti” sculptures and many other artists I admired.\nThe fact I forged was that I was not bright minded enough to create something myself.\nThat is why I always tell people, “I am not an artist but I make art”…\n…I did try, (after my prison sentence) to make my own art but the public does not seem to like it very much. \nBut please do not worry, I will not forge “ART” any more.\n\nI am very happy that Driessen no longer creates forgeries, and I hope other forgers follow his good example. But we need to stop celebrating forgery in popular culture as “a few rascals getting one over on the rich and powerful” and call it out for the irreparable damage it does to our shared cultural history. That said, I don’t believe anyone, even forgers, are all good or all bad. I believe everyone can change, and I believe that people deserve second chances. I also believe that if you see something as a problem (forgers and forgery in this case), it is better to engage with the problem and try to understand it than it is to ignore it and hope it goes away on its own. \nIn the spirit of better understanding forgers, I’d meant to interview Robert Driessen since he reached out t...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5d86827b68af8823781cf279","isoDate":"2019-09-24T10:08:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"September 24, 2019","image":""},{"creator":"David Young","title":"Tabula Rasa - Rethinking the intelligence of machine minds","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/9/17/tabula-rasa-rethinking-the-intelligence-of-machine-minds","pubDate":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 08:00:00 +0000","dc:creator":"David Young","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568663725784-7QNSOJ1F4RMWE3HGP5PW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67h2_002441_1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1024x1024\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"b67h2_002441_1.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7fe8ab3fcb3a0f13de9771\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568663725784-7QNSOJ1F4RMWE3HGP5PW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67h2_002441_1.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Foreword By Jason Bailey</strong></p><p class=\"\">“<em>While rationalism would say that the machine learns emotions from the training data, romanticism instead poses that they are innate.</em>” - David Young</p><p class=\"\">“<em>In addition to memories from a long-distant conscious past, completely new thoughts and creative ideas can… present themselves from the unconscious – thoughts and ideas that have never been conscious before. </em>” - Carl Jung </p><p class=\"\">David Young is one of the most articulate artists working in the AI art space today. Not only can he explain the technical workings of machine learning models like GANs (generative adversarial networks), but he is also expert in sharing his philosophical views on AI and how these views impact his artistic practice. </p><p class=\"\">In his important essay <em>Tabula Rasa - Rethinking the Intelligence of Machine Minds</em>, Young compares the untrained machine learning model to John Locke’s conception of the human mind as a “tabla rasa,” or “blank tablet.” As Young explains, Locke believed we develop rational knowledge from our experiences in the natural world. As with the human brain, it is thought that machine learning models are also blank slates until they are trained on data. But as Young points out, machine learning models are trained on biased data curated by humans, and not (as with the human brain) on the natural world:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Given that the machine is reflecting on the sensation of biased data, what makes us think that the machine can possibly be rational? We must consider that the rationality offered by these systems may be an illusion. </p></blockquote><p class=\"\">How are we to think of the machine learning model if, as Young proposes, it may not, in fact, be rational? Young reminds us that the Romantic movement served as an antidote to the rationalism of the enlightenment and wonders aloud if we may need a similar antidote for our understanding of machine learning. </p><p class=\"\">During the Romantic period of the arts, we placed “the artist’s&nbsp;<em>emotions </em>as the most authentic source of aesthetic experience,” according to Young. Young then asks if human emotion might be a better analogy than human rationalism when comparing AI to humans.</p><p class=\"\">I’d personally like to offer up a Jungian alternative to the Lockean interpretation of the mind as a tabula rasa. Rather than starting with a “blank slate,” Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that we are all born with a set of shared ideas, a “collective unconscious.”  According to Jung, this collective unconscious is filled with archetypes and visual symbols that resonate universally within humans regardless of their individual experience, geography, or era.  </p><p class=\"\">The artistic genius, according to Jung, was one who could pluck these universal symbols from the collective unconscious and manifest them as physical and tangible works of art. According to Jung, one way to do this was to tap into dreams. Jung posits that in dreams, the collective unconscious become more accessible. But what does this have to do with art? </p><p class=\"\">Jung’s ideas on archetypes, dreams, and the collective unconscious were hugely influential on twentieth-century art, in particular with the Surrealists and the Abstract Expressionists. Artists including Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko were heavily influenced by Jung’s writing and ideas, and <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.606.5437&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">many argue</a> they saw themselves as tapping into the collective unconscious to unlock these archetypes and Jungian symbols through their work.</p><p class=\"\">Whether we buy into Jung’s ideas of the collective unconscious or not, I think that we can agree that the best known abstract painters tapped into something primal which continues to resonate across boundaries, be they cultural, geographic, or generational. </p><p class=\"\">When David Young shared a contact sheet of work from his latest machine learning model which was trained on minimal data, I was shocked at how similar the images were to twentieth-century abstract paintings.</p><p class=\"\">Take a look at the

like abstract paintings from the twentieth century. We have seen many other AI artists create models designed to generate convincing new imagery in the style of past artists and artistic movements. But in Young’s case, this could not be further from his goals and objectives. In fact, when I came back to Young with this connection to abstract painting, he was actually a little put off at first as his intention had been to unlock a new aesthetic through AI (as he explains in his essay), not to revisit Abstract Expressionism.    </p><p class=\"\">This led me to wonder, could it be possible that machine learning models also have a collective unconscious? If so, could that collective unconscious include some of the same archetypes and symbols we have as humans? Is it possible that a machine learning model, when given little to no training material (as with David’s <em>Tabla Rasa </em>model), produces symbols that may come largely from its own collective unconscious rather than the sparse data it has been trained on? </p><p class=\"\">I’m a pretty rational guy, and I am not sure if I fully believe Jung’s theories of the collective unconscious or that machines could potentially share that unconscious with humans. But I will say that the similarities between Young’s <em>Tabula Rasa</em> images and the abstract paintings of the twentieth century are uncanny. The similarities go beyond a surface-level visual comparison, extending to how they are conceived and appreciated. </p><p class=\"\">Both David’s <em>Tabula Rasa</em> model and the Abstract Expressionist painters are trying to create artwork that taps into an unconscious knowledge, a knowledge that is developed before exposure to large volumes of external data. From an appreciation standpoint, both David’s images and the art of the Abstract Expressionists resonate on the same frequency for me. I believe Young has tapped into the same well that all great abstract art springs from - even if none of us could pin down that well’s location or even fully define it. </p><p class=\"\">I’d like to thank David Young for giving me the opportunity to share my alternative interpretation of his work. In my experience the best artwork prompts multiple interpretations, and the greatest artists welcome those interpretations from others. </p><p class=\"\">With that, I’m honored to share David’s thoughtful essay in its entirety below.</p><hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568487584955-10FJ7JCN4B969EHDN62V/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHuTq4dtTufCFalxt2ZOhk8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dgjRJMQhZpGYMFnNuRlF-O1Vg9Zrl_-gegvnedB4BICYG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/1_05pyN1Zto6fZftpyfxdIPA.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1500x502\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"1_05pyN1Zto6fZftpyfxdIPA.jpeg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7d38a0e29ef95f6447f6c4\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568487584955-10FJ7JCN4B969EHDN62V/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHuTq4dtTufCFalxt2ZOhk8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dgjRJMQhZpGYMFnNuRlF-O1Vg9Zrl_-gegvnedB4BICYG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/1_05pyN1Zto6fZftpyfxdIPA.jpeg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<h1>Tabula Rasa</h1><h2>Rethinking the intelligence of machine minds</h2><p class=\"\"><br>Although AI has been around since the 1950s, advances over the past decade, particularly in machine learning, have brought about a radical change in what we call AI.</p><p class=\"\">With this “new AI” programmers no longer encode rules but instead build network frameworks. Then, using large quantities of data, the networks are trained and their components adjusted — or tweaked — until the system starts performing as desired.</p><p class=\"\">Part of the magic, and the enigma, of AI is that we can’t open up a trained network to see what “rules” it has learned, because it doesn’t have any. Its understanding has developed organically, from the bottom up. And, as a result, it is not possible to fully know why the machine behaves as it does.</p><p class=\"\">Despite this mysterious opacity, the future is being built on AI. It is poised to be the latest in the inevitable progression of technologies that brings greater efficiency and optimization of all aspects of our lives — with little regard for any unintended consequences. And so we are resigned to the inevitable disruption that will follow in AI’s wake, cynically aware of how it may be used for the benefit of those in power, and that most people will have very little say in what that future will be.</p><p class=\"\">It is in this context that artists have been exploring AI — as subject matter, as collaborator, and as a medium.</p><p class=\"\">Like AI programmers, artists working with AI don’t encode rules, but instead train networks. The resulting artworks look and feel different from previous forms of computer-based art for they reflect the organic messiness of their vast and inscrutable neural networks.</p><p class=\"\">My own work with AI, created with GANs (generative adversarial networks), exists in contrast to the vast scale of commercial AI. Using small data sets I am exploring how AI builds an understanding the natural world, and how the images I create relate to earlier art movements and technological innovations. (More information is in my previous essay&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dkyy/little-ai-298fcba0832d\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Little AI</em></a>.)</p><p class=\"\">In this essay, I step back from that broader project in order to examine the very basics of AI. I want to learn what is fundamentally different about art made with AI. Can I then use that difference to create unique images?</p><p class=\"\">Through all of my work I ask: Do we need to develop a new concept of beauty to evaluate what emerges from working with these systems? And is it possible that a new aesthetic can give us a better, more empowered, understanding of AI?</p><h2>Romanticism</h2><p class=\"\">Fundamental to AI and machine learning is the concept of training — teaching the machine to understand its subject. But what does it mean for the machine to “know” something?</p><p class=\"\">In philosophy, John Locke (1632–1704) proposed that the&nbsp;<em>only </em>knowledge humans can have is through experience. He believed the mind to be a&nbsp;<em>tabula rasa&nbsp;</em> —  a “white paper” or “blank tablet”  —  “on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person’s life proceeds are written. There are thus two sources of our knowledge and ideas:&nbsp;<em>sensation and reflection</em>.”¹</p><p class=\"\">This sounds remarkably similar to a contemporary AI system and how it learns. Just as with Locke’s conception of the mind, the machine begins as a blank tablet, knowing nothing. It is then trained with data  —  the “sensation” upon which it “reflects”  —  in order to learn.</p><p class=\"\">In Locke’s model, one develops rational knowledge from experiences in the natural world. But unfortunately, the data we provide to the machine is not neutral, for embedded within all data are human biases — the preconceptions, irrationalities, and emotions of those who collected it. Even the tools we use to collect that data — from their interfaces that control what we can see, to their underlying APIs, code libraries, and sensor technologies — each adds its own particular bias. The technology stack is, essentially, a stack of bias.</p><p class=\"\">Art created with AI is not exempt from this bias problem. The images that the artist selects to train the machine — whether created by the artist, or collected from other sources — can have numerous layers of human bias.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412188437-ZE1IWJR6VLNKU0X0452L/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGfiFqkITS6axXxhYYUCnlRZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpx1B3uKuIxKkeNobmVrkfsvhi7vfNIYPwuNoe0YQqN5qRcQyCP0lZkCSDZ8KLElTzs/b38_002519_03.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"512x512\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"There’s more bias here than may be immediately apparent. “Learning Nature (b38,2519,3\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7c121c78e10150b4e12155\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412188437-ZE1IWJR6VLNKU0X0452L/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGfiFqkITS6axXxhYYUCnlRZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpx1B3uKuIxKkeNobmVrkfsvhi7vfNIYPwuNoe0YQqN5qRcQyCP0lZkCSDZ8KLElTzs/b38_002519_03.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">There’s more bias here than may be immediately apparent. “Learning Nature (b38,2519,3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Given that the machine is reflecting on the sensation of biased data, what makes us think that the machine can possibly be rational?

Really?? This is just code! But… because the technology is inscrutable we haven’t been able to develop alternative metaphors for what it is doing. We remain constrained by language that leaves us with no choice other than to describe the process as if an entity is doing it. So emotions seem to be as good as any other method to build a new understanding about AI. A linguistic placeholder, perhaps, but a place to start.</p><p class=\"\">While rationalism would say that the machine learns emotions from the training data, romanticism instead poses that they are innate. What if, in order to better understand the source of the machine’s emotions, we could train it using data that doesn’t have any embedded emotional bias? Doing so might then allow us to see if the machine exhibits any emotions, and if so, reveal something about their development.</p><p class=\"\">Starting with solid colors, material which is theoretically bias-free, I started training with just a single black image. The machine, seeing nothing but black, learns nothing but black. And while we might imagine it cruel to deprive it of any stimulus, I didn’t really think that I was destroying an innate intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412283662-6M21B505571269X2JHSR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67c_000004_2.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1024x1024\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"b67c_000004_2.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7c127a7e85cf79bae239fe\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412283662-6M21B505571269X2JHSR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67c_000004_2.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412299184-LFMV8V6F04M1ZQIY5J51/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67d4_000030_1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1024x1024\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Not much to see when training on a single black image.\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7c128afef3e33f1bce0103\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412299184-LFMV8V6F04M1ZQIY5J51/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67d4_000030_1.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Not much to see when training on a single black image.</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412316138-EJ2WH3FSLASTJ8H1VJQW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67d5_000072_1.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1024x1024\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"b67d5_000072_1.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7c129c5f172734865082ac\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568412316138-EJ2WH3FSLASTJ8H1VJQW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLXCf88_9uNTKXkq27cF4sB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmzUsryC7riGV7bTeYhg5Sep4Y8p3OCJVqs3FfNTLch3O2M0DsfUdwheg190rC2-Re/b67d5_000072_1.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">When I add a second color — a second sensation — we see more activity in the machine’s mind.

There are periods of relative calm; the gentle tranquility of a machine mind incrementally building its understanding.

But this chaos is different from when it first started learning — informed by its previous reflections.</p><p class=\"\">Were these emotions present within the machine as it was creating? Are these images the expressions of an emotional mind? I would say that is highly unlikely.

AI’s inelegance reflects many of the worst aspects of our modern era — our obsessions with speed, consumption, and scale; traits which not only polarize our society, but threaten to destroy our planet.</p><p class=\"\">But looking at AI through the lens of romanticism liberates us from trying to enforce rationality on AI. We can embrace the “emotional” qualities of how it learns and understands — and how it creates. For it is by stepping away from mainstream AI, training the machine on reduced material and making a system of limited effectiveness, that we are revealing what is unique about it.</p><p class=\"\">The strangeness of the works, with their evocation of the sublime, gives us pause to reconsider the inevitability of AI. And their beauty enable us to embrace AI, for beauty is an antidote. It excites the imagination. It gives us something to hold in our minds and reflect upon. It lets us contemplate what is special about this technology.</p><p class=\"\">Art gives us the space to develop new intuitions for AI. It empowers us to consider alternatives for what AI can be, and for the world we want in the future.</p><hr /><p class=\"\"><em>Those interested in learning more about David and his work should read the excellent writing on his </em><a href=\"http://www.triplecode.com/\"><em>personal website</em></a><em> and visit the </em><a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/\"><em>Kate Vass Galerie</em></a><em> to see additional work.</em></p>","contentSnippet":"Foreword By Jason Bailey\n“While rationalism would say that the machine learns emotions from the training data, romanticism instead poses that they are innate.” - David Young\n“In addition to memories from a long-distant conscious past, completely new thoughts and creative ideas can… present themselves from the unconscious – thoughts and ideas that have never been conscious before. ” - Carl Jung \nDavid Young is one of the most articulate artists working in the AI art space today. Not only can he explain the technical workings of machine learning models like GANs (generative adversarial networks), but he is also expert in sharing his philosophical views on AI and how these views impact his artistic practice. \nIn his important essay Tabula Rasa - Rethinking the Intelligence of Machine Minds, Young compares the untrained machine learning model to John Locke’s conception of the human mind as a “tabla rasa,” or “blank tablet.” As Young explains, Locke believed we develop rational knowledge from our experiences in the natural world. As with the human brain, it is thought that machine learning models are also blank slates until they are trained on data. But as Young points out, machine learning models are trained on biased data curated by humans, and not (as with the human brain) on the natural world:\n\nGiven that the machine is reflecting on the sensation of biased data, what makes us think that the machine can possibly be rational? We must consider that the rationality offered by these systems may be an illusion. \n\nHow are we to think of the machine learning model if, as Young proposes, it may not, in fact, be rational? Young reminds us that the Romantic movement served as an antidote to the rationalism of the enlightenment and wonders aloud if we may need a similar antidote for our understanding of machine learning. \nDuring the Romantic period of the arts, we placed “the artist’s emotions as the most authentic source of aesthetic experience,” according to Young. Young then asks if human emotion might be a better analogy than human rationalism when comparing AI to humans.\nI’d personally like to offer up a Jungian alternative to the Lockean interpretation of the mind as a tabula rasa. Rather than starting with a “blank slate,” Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that we are all born with a set of shared ideas, a “collective unconscious.”  According to Jung, this collective unconscious is filled with archetypes and visual symbols that resonate universally within humans regardless of their individual experience, geography, or era.  \nThe artistic genius, according to Jung, was one who could pluck these universal symbols from the collective unconscious and manifest them as physical and tangible works of art. According to Jung, one way to do this was to tap into dreams. Jung posits that in dreams, the collective unconscious become more accessible. But what does this have to do with art? \nJung’s ideas on archetypes, dreams, and the collective unconscious were...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5d7c112c78e10150b4e10827","isoDate":"2019-09-17T08:00:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"September 17, 2019","image":""},{"creator":"Jason Bailey","title":"Can AI Art Authentication Put An End To Art Forgery?","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/9/12/can-ai-art-authentication-put-an-end-to-art-forgery","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:57:00 +0000","dc:creator":"Jason Bailey","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568305734045-UIVS0O3FPO5BTO8WW48G/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kH1Q69hqGCr87phJc9B1kTpZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIk8EW6eU8Mb2crUGRoTaQYkPqUTTTxQr0KMIm2rHYe3M/Beltracchi.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"750x376\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Left:  La Horde , Beltracchi fake in the style of Max Ernst.

Have you always been technically inclined?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Carina Popovici:</strong> Indeed, I have always been technically inclined. Back in my home country of Romania, I went to a high school with strong focus on math and physics. I was fascinated by the physics of elementary particles, which later also become my main topic of research. At the same time, I always had a strong interest in arts, not just visual, but also literature and theater. I mostly like Surrealists – Dali is my favorite, but in recent years I discovered Max Ernst, whom I find quite amazing.</p><p class=\"\">Another artist I admire is Modigliani, also because of his turbulent life and tragic death. Although strictly professionally, Modigliani is probably not the best choice, being as he is the most forged artist of modern times.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567890866417-IY0YHVS38JTBI3F94ZSA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJ6Q3sj3cLldhBwLiwz_ZJ1Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpwDDndKpCue4hsR61LHd212fkI6zZem_VbyAVY2ft_t68A-oJ7JYSlUufXBq5I3xG0/Modigliani_Forgery.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"690x783\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Portrait of a Woman,  by the Modigliani forger Elmyr de Hory, circa 1974\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d741db1df09514a97854227\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567890866417-IY0YHVS38JTBI3F94ZSA/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJ6Q3sj3cLldhBwLiwz_ZJ1Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpwDDndKpCue4hsR61LHd212fkI6zZem_VbyAVY2ft_t68A-oJ7JYSlUufXBq5I3xG0/Modigliani_Forgery.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><em>Portrait of a Woman,</em> by the Modigliani forger Elmyr de Hory, circa 1974</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> How did you and your co-founder Christiane meet and decide to start a company together to detect art forgery?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We met at Switzerland’s largest bank where we worked together for a while. Our career paths have split, but we stayed friends. And when the idea of an AI program to detect art forgeries eventually emerged, we discussed it thoroughly together. In 2017, I started working on the algorithm full time, while Christiane followed one year after. Meanwhile, it became clear that the program has a great potential and there is a huge interest on the market, so at the beginning of 2019 we decided to take the plunge and start a business here in Zurich.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> Your academic background is in particle physics. How does this translate to using machine learning to identify forgery in art?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We have a lot of practical experience in applying mathematical/machine learning (ML) models on large data sets. The problems that we’ve worked on across the years are of very different natures, yet they all require the capacity to translate a specific problem (which can be in physics, finance, and now art) into a mathematical model and then find the right method to solve it. What is also common to all applications is the ability to find ways to handle data which are not as good as you would wish them to be. You need to continuously improve the models and use your creativity to make them solve the issue at hand. Also, neural networks were already a hot topic 15 years ago, but only in recent years new algorithms and computing power which can handle the large data at a sufficient pace became available.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> How does the actual Art Recognition algorithm work? What is the model actually looking at in the artwork? Are there aspects of it that are essentially a black box, or are you able to understand all aspects of the analysis?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> The algorithm is based on a deep convolutional neuronal network which we train to “learn” the characteristics of an artist from a set of original artworks by that artist. Once the training has been completed, the algorithm has learned with extremely high precision the characteristics of that artist.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">When a new, previously unseen artwork is being analyzed, the same type of features are collected and compared to the already stored one. If they match, the new image is labeled as original; otherwise, it is a fake. Probabilities to distinguish original from fake can be higher than 90% depending on the style and artist, and we are continuously working on improving accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The black box character of AI algorithms is, of course, very well known. We as developers do not wish to bias the training. Therefore, we allow the network to choose itself the relevant features; the only feature which we give as “input” is the brushstroke. This comes at a cost, as it is not easy to find out what features have actually been learned. So we came up with the idea of producing a heat map which is meant to provide a visual interpretation of the decision process.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567861751730-TV936BSV9O1AARKNOO3L/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMj0ShoaYzWmhP_E9y1-tm9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpyV4yGhf629OZ3JfH_NWdm2bcgC5fBMd91yNW7gEnK3AHlzhDPDg63HrCuXrxhm0k8/Pechstein-DW-Politik-FRANKFURT-jpg.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"600x586\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Beltracchi fake in the style of Max Pechstein\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d73abf7a677d754f43af6a4\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567861751730-TV936BSV9O1AARKNOO3L/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMj0ShoaYzWmhP_E9y1-tm9Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpyV4yGhf629OZ3JfH_NWdm2bcgC5fBMd91yNW7gEnK3AHlzhDPDg63HrCuXrxhm0k8/Pechstein-DW-Politik-FRANKFURT-jpg.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Beltracchi fake in the style of Max Pechstein</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567861634660-KG8CNIR2TF5X9T0TVSIZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJxCTvErkmR5Uq8aGzXw3dZZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVGoYHE5rOsU_vSrWTAiqe7Pm2mTy8nBqSeWuNwdPPsxcD-3CTWZQ124CTRPXn-dnvM/HM_Beltracchi-Max_Pechstein-02.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"409x410\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Art Recognition heat map highlighting areas of concern\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d73ab82f7fc2410b6a9633f\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567861634660-KG8CNIR2TF5X9T0TVSIZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJxCTvErkmR5Uq8aGzXw3dZZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVGoYHE5rOsU_vSrWTAiqe7Pm2mTy8nBqSeWuNwdPPsxcD-3CTWZQ124CTRPXn-dnvM/HM_Beltracchi-Max_Pechstein-02.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Art Recognition heat map highlighting areas of concern</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> What advantages does Art Recognition’s approach have over traditional art authentication and forgery detection tools/approaches?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> One advantage is that the analysis can be run based on images alone - no transport of the original artwork is necessary. Another advantage is the speed, as we deliver our result in just a few days or even hours, whereas traditional committees sometimes need months. The method is not invasive; one doesn’t need to remove samples from the artwork, as it is done for chemical analyses. Finally, we believe that the objectivity provided through the computer is also an advantage, especially in cases where experts disagree and have long-lasting disputes.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> A combination of cloud computing and open-source machine learning platforms like Tensor Flow have made it easier than ever for anyone to use machine learning. What does Art Recognition do that other people could not do on their own with these freely available ML models? What is your secret sauce, your competitive edge?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We have been working on the algorithm for roughly three years now, continuously improving it and taking our experience from other fields into account. The algorithm is specifically streamlined for art authentication, and it includes a number of technical tweaks for that purpose. It works flawlessly and delivers very high accuracy.

We only use images from trusted and verified sources such as catalogue raisonnés or museum databases. Ideally, the images should be of high resolution in order to make finer details available to the algorithm. If the resolution allows it, we generate several patches per image, thus augmenting the data set and making sure that no information is lost.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">We use a convolutional autoencoder as a feature extractor. The autoencoder is trained with mean pixel-wise reconstruction loss, but we also add some terms to the loss function adapted from style transfer. The piece coming from transfer learning has the explicit purpose of capturing the main brushstroke characteristics. All other features are trained from the scratch.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> What type of information do you provide your clients with after the analysis is run?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We provide a technical report showing the result (original/fake) together with the probability, and a heat map showing the main features which led to the decision.

How do you think about this balance?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We agree with this. That is why we include in the training both the patches, which capture the low-level features as well as the images as a whole which contain important information about the composition. We have even noticed that for some artists such as Manet, this type of overall structure is at least as important as the details of the painting.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> Does your approach tend to work better for certain types of artworks (drawings vs. paintings) or certain artists (Realism vs. Abstract)?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> So far, we have concentrated on paintings and only analyzed a few drawings, also because we mostly got requests on painting. We are working on enhancing the model to better handle drawings.</p><p class=\"\">In terms of artists, the algorithm tends to work better on Impressionists, the reason being that this style is very rich in structure and brushstrokes are mostly well defined. But we are also happy with the results on other styles (Post-Impressionism, Expressionism). We actually analyzed only one painter with elements of Abstract art (Auguste Herbin).

This means some images may have a high level of detail while others may not. Do you have any concerns that this could inadvertently introduce bias?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We do train on paintings of very different sizes, some larger and some very small. Our approach is to scale and crop all the images (both patches and full paintings) to equal size before feeding them into the neural network. While this doesn’t solve directly the problem of actual vs. digital size, it does make the analysis thoroughly consistent. The different levels of detail are blended together in the learning process, and that is perfectly okay if we are satisfied with the validation accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> I am fond of saying that data and analysis are only as good as your ability to communicate the results. I love your heat maps because they are so intuitive and easy to understand. Can you share a bit more about how you are generating them?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> Thank you. The heat maps are generated by evaluating the “importance” of each pixel in the decision process – the technical word for it is “weighted evidence.” In practice, this is done by removing a small number of pixels, replacing it by the average of the environment, and recalculating the overall class probability with this modified input. By comparing this new probability with the original class probability, one can check what is the influence of this group of pixels on the probability value. The process is repeated by going through the whole image and storing the modified probabilities. These variations result in different patterns and are being assigned different colors.</p><p class=\"\">The patterns emerging as explained above basically show what are the features that had the biggest weight in the decision process, the idea being to make the decision of the network more understandable for the human viewer. In general, heat spots occur in the regions which comprise more structure (corners, edges, shapes, etc.), but they can also appear on flat pieces where the brushstroke changes direction.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB: </strong>Do you see Art Recognition as being robust enough to detect forgeries on its own or is this just the first step in the journey for collectors who want to authenticate work from their collections? If just the first step, what other steps do collectors take after you have analyzed a photo of the work in question?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> All tests have shown that the Art Recognition program and results are very robust. However, we think that a rigorous investigation, especially when it comes to very valuable pieces, should also include other aspects, such as provenance research. All the elements can then be put together to reach the final conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The Art Recognition results could be, for example, used by the collectors as a precheck before approaching an art expert, but also by the art connoisseurs themselves as an additional piece of evidence when delivering their expertise.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> What other scientific approaches and tools do you think best compliment Art Recognition’s machine learning-based detection?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> Chemical analysis of pigments or carbon detection can help to find out if the materials used (canvas, paint) are from a certain time period, but that is, of course, no guarantee that the artwork is actually original. In fact, it is known that skilled forgers have prepared pigments contemporary to the artist they forged and also used the canvas of ‘worthless’ paintings from which they stripped off the color.</p><p class=\"\">One aspect which is very important for us is the quality of the images. The company <a href=\"https://artmyn.com/#home\"><span>Artmyn</span></a>, based also here in Switzerland, is using high-tech scanners and cutting-edge technology to produce very high-resolution images. This kind of input would certainly help Art Recognition to deliver even better results.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> Do you see AI and machine learning eventually replacing human authenticators, or do you see AI/ML as a tool that will augment human connoisseurship?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We see AI/ML as a helping tool to increase human connoisseurship. It can be especially helpful if experts disagree or they decided not to opine on authenticity anymore. Other situations where we could help are the cases where the authentication committees have dissolved or where simply no expert exists.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> The art world can be notoriously conservative and slow to adopt new technologies. How has your technology been received so far? What objections have surfaced and how are you dealing with them?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> More or less all the art specialist we have worked and spoken with were very enthusiastic about our service and gave us a lot of honest feedback. Every encounter which happened over the past three years has helped with improving our service.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">There have been, of course, also a few situations where people showed doubt and were straightforwardly reluctant to the idea of bringing AI methods into art. As you say, these are the very conservative and rather old-school personalities. Our strategy in such cases is to simply demonstrate that it works. For example, on a painting which we analyzed, the expert was quite amazed to see not only that the result was correct, but also that the features highlighted on the heat map were matching exactly on his expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">We are currently working closely with art experts not only to ensure the product we provide is really useful for them, but also to gain credibility in the market.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> The world of authentication is very high stakes. A work being deemed authentic or forged can mean the difference between a painting being worth tens of millions of dollars or essentially nothing. Because of this, several authentication boards have been tangled up in lawsuits with angry collectors who disagree with their opinions. The Warhol authentication board famously ran out of money for this reason and had to disband. As a fledgling two-person startup just getting off the ground, how are you thinking about the potential for these issues?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567959533531-QCLI40SFWX81MFGB4A66/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFhBvoOT_T_XJoP5vLyfYj57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmo3_5ncHsS_KC884-Z46vJYDwxoMtSQTBn2FvVH-PxhO8A_ieWM3bqFIKx2THlYh-/147891-8959320-WarholRedSelfPortraitsRGB_jpg.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1000x1207\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Self Portrait that was central to the law suit leading to the shut down of the Warhol authentication board\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d7529eca677d754f45291f5\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1567959533531-QCLI40SFWX81MFGB4A66/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFhBvoOT_T_XJoP5vLyfYj57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmo3_5ncHsS_KC884-Z46vJYDwxoMtSQTBn2FvVH-PxhO8A_ieWM3bqFIKx2THlYh-/147891-8959320-WarholRedSelfPortraitsRGB_jpg.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Self Portrait that was central to the law suit leading to the shut down of the Warhol authentication board</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We are indeed aware of all of the legal issues which can potentially emerge. We also know that some art experts seem to move away from “authentication” for the reasons you mention. Yet because of the (occasionally) hostile view towards authentication, I think it is even more important to have at hand a tool which is completely objective, emotionless, and has no fear of lawsuits.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">While we are continuously working on improving the accuracy, it is well known that, by its nature, no AI algorithm can be 100% certain. We ensure our clients that the analysis is done most carefully and with due diligence, but we also explain to them that we cannot provide 100% accuracy.

What are these other folks missing that the two of you see in the potential for this solution/approach?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> It would be interesting to know <em>why</em> are those folks suspicious. In any case, teaching computers how to model large amounts of data in a meaningful way is nowadays a global trend reaching out to all domains, and I don’t see why art — or art authentication, for that matter — should be an exception. When developing an algorithm for a problem which is a rather atypical, one should, of course, take into consideration the particularities of that problem. To give you an example, when preprocessing the images, we are careful to not cut them into patches smaller than the brushstroke and we make sure to remove effects such as light spots, shadows, etc. Our network architecture is also specifically designed for this type of image recognition. So I wouldn’t say that there is a big secret that people out there are missing, but rather many small details which should be embedded at every step of analysis in order to have it working properly.</p><p class=\"\">Finally, the results alone should speak for themselves, as in all tests, the algorithm worked perfectly well.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> What is the long-term vision for Art Recognition?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> Our vision is that Art Recognition will become a trusted label and that every artwork coming up on sale has been checked by our algorithm.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><strong>JB:</strong> Why have you decided to partner up with Artnome?</p><p class=\"\"><strong>CP:</strong> We are really thrilled to see that you are so enthusiastic about the same topics as we are, and it is great fun to team up and move the case forward together.

Our algorithm then analyzes the image, and within few days, we get back to them with a full report.

Right: heat map highlighting areas suggesting forgery\nIn June of 2006, Christie’s auction house put the 1927 painting La Horde by artist Max Ernst on the cover of the catalog for their evening sale of Impressionist and Modern art. Typically the catalog cover is reserved for the most exciting work in the sale, and Christie’s was certain they had a clear winner with this Surrealist masterpiece. As they wrote in the May 2006 press release leading up to the sale:  \n\nLeading the Surrealist section of the sale is La Horde, 1927 (estimate £2,500,000-3,500,000), one of the finest examples from a small series of strange and powerful paintings by Max Ernst, made with his then newly discovered grattage technique. “This exciting discovery is the most important work by Max Ernst to appear at auction in at least a decade,” said Olivier Camu, co-head of the evening sale. \n\nThere was only one problem… the “most important work by Max Ernst to appear at auction in at least a decade” was actually created by notorious art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. \nWolfgang Beltracchi in studio\nSomeone did a pretty good job of burying Christie’s information on this embarrassing sale, but after a fair amount of detective work, I was able to track down a link to the press release and a low-res image of the catalog on Pinterest.\nTo be clear, I don’t think Christie’s was being negligent. I am sure they spent top dollar on due diligence to authenticate La Horde before bringing it to auction in such a bold and public way.  The problem is human connoisseurship is more fallible than most in the art world want to believe or admit. \nOther industries relying on human expertise and visual acuity for high-stakes decision making are realizing that AI can improve outcomes. For example, new research from Google published in the journal Nature Medicine last May shows that artificial intelligence is “as good or better than doctors at identifying lung cancer in CT scans”. \nCredit: Nature Medicine Overall modeling framework.\nThe question is, can artificial intelligence be “as good or better” than art authentication experts in detecting that paintings like La Horde are forgeries? The answer is yes.\nTwo women in Switzerland, Dr. Carina Popovici and her co-founder Christiane Hoppe-Oehl, have developed an algorithm that correctly detected La Horde and several other known fakes using just a single photograph of the artworks in question. Their solution, the Art Recognition algorithm, looks at brushstrokes and produces an easy-to-read heat map that pinpoints which areas of the painting are most suspect. Their neural network is trained using machine learning and a comprehensive set of images of the artist’s works.  \nArt Recognition cofounders Christiane Hoppe-Oehl and Dr. Carina Popovici\nFairly skeptical and armed with a long list of technical questions (from myself and others), I set up a call with Dr. Carina Popovici to get a better understanding o...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5d70f83e4d2a670001b16874","isoDate":"2019-09-12T11:57:00.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"September 12, 2019","image":""},{"creator":"Casey Reas","title":"Collecting in the Age of Digital Reproduction","link":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/9/9/collecting-in-the-age-of-digital-reproduction","pubDate":"Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:29:58 +0000","dc:creator":"Casey Reas","content":"<figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568067931632-UC13KLRIL9AWM9RLVJXI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGuhhpSJh_rTEOK_3SVTIvwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcJjoHssu_e0u5N1L9AhT4LRWT4SHmZzY738QmSgLu0xb57T7luQosZEMCqn4FIq6u/1_dUktNFu5g6NL9v43hiysVg+%281%29.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1210x832\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Image still from Walk It Back (2018), directed by Casey Reas\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d76d15ba4522141cb7794f9\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1568067931632-UC13KLRIL9AWM9RLVJXI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGuhhpSJh_rTEOK_3SVTIvwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcJjoHssu_e0u5N1L9AhT4LRWT4SHmZzY738QmSgLu0xb57T7luQosZEMCqn4FIq6u/1_dUktNFu5g6NL9v43hiysVg+%281%29.jpeg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Image still from Walk It Back (2018), directed by Casey Reas</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Foreword by Jason Bailey</strong></p><p class=\"\"><em>I have a handful of people I consider personal heroes in the world of generative art.

These deviations may include a contract, a set of instructions, a digital video file, or a software file. These are all examples of art as&nbsp;<em>information</em>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<em>material</em>. For example, a purely digital photograph is different from a printed photograph or negative. A digital photo stores an image as a sequence of colors defined as numbers that can be exhibited on a screen or projected. In contrast, a printed photograph is continuous tones of gray or color values that are embedded in the structure of a unique piece of paper.</p><p class=\"\">While more and more digital media works are created by artists, the art market has been hesitant to collect works that are not tangible and tactile. In contrast, other kinds of collecting not related to the art market have shifted toward digital, information archives. The most iconic shift from material to digital collecting has happened with music. Traditional art collecting and traditional music collecting have little in common. Art artifacts are typically one-of-a-kind or in limited editions in quantities much smaller than pressings of a vinyl record or compact disc. However, contemporary music collecting and the future of collecting contemporary art might eventually be more similar than different — this is the speculation of this text.</p><h2>Collecting Files</h2><p class=\"\">The shift in collecting music was the transition where the&nbsp;<em>information</em>&nbsp;version of the media was in more demand than the&nbsp;<em>material</em>&nbsp;form — when the desire for the MP3 files of an album or track eclipsed desire for the vinyl or compact disc. The widespread catalyst for this change was a piece of software called Napster and how this software engaged people with peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing. This was enabled by the internet and through a cultural shift in ideas about sharing media.</p><p class=\"\">When Napster was released in 1999, it started a new way of collecting, sharing, and trading. Before this, people could copy tapes and compact discs for friends, but the scale, speed, and ease of sharing through p2p systems made this new way fundamentally different from what came before. The distribution system of brick-and-mortar stores vs. direct download have little comparison. Behaviors and ideas about property shifted quickly. In 1999, a search for Aphex Twin made it easy to download the&nbsp;<em>Richard D. James Album</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Come to Daddy</em>. No payment was needed and none was expected by people using the software. These files were being&nbsp;<em>shared</em>&nbsp;by many computers around the world and they were quickly transferred to any connected computer. This same pattern, followed again and again, could lead to downloading hundreds of hours of music without any payment. This&nbsp;<em>felt</em>&nbsp;normal at the time, but it wasn’t legal. The response from the gatekeepers and copyright holders was controversial and punitive — people were prosecuted.</p><p class=\"\">As music distribution transitioned from records to tapes to compact discs, the primary model was the same. The collector would buy a&nbsp;<em>thing</em>: a vinyl disk with grooves, a magnetic tape wound around spools, a thin polycarbonate circle encased in plastic. Tapes and compact discs were different than records because of the ease of making copies. In the case of tapes, they were noisy and copies degraded, and with compact discs, they were perfect copies. However, from vinyl to compact disks, the model of buying an object that became&nbsp;<em>property</em>&nbsp;was continuous. A collector could visit the used record store on Canal Street and sell her copy of&nbsp;<em>Remain in Light</em>&nbsp;because she owned that object. That same collector could also buy a used copy of&nbsp;<em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>&nbsp;that someone had earlier sold to the store. The full story of collecting records, tapes, and compact discs has another layer to it. Because these objects became property when they were bought, the owner could loan them to other people for as long as she wanted.&nbsp;<em>The Queen is Dead</em>&nbsp;could be loaned to a friend for a few weeks and if she liked it, that tape could be traded for&nbsp;<em>Three Imaginary Boys</em>. This whole system was flexible and legal and it worked well.</p><p class=\"\">Today, people still buy compact discs, tapes, and records, but new options are more dominant and maybe more importantly, they are more convenient. Streaming services provide wide, but still limited, libraries of music. When music is purchased, it’s often digital files, either one song at a time or a full album of tracks. However, if a song is bought as a digital file for ninety-nine cents, this is different from buying a used cassette single for the same price. The cassette is property and the digital file is&nbsp;<em>licensed</em>. The license states that the music isn’t owned by the person who buys it. That person doesn’t have the right to loan it to someone or to resell it. In fact, that person doesn’t even have the right to give it to someone. This is legal, but it doesn’t feel right. This is the era of the arcane end-user-license agreement (EULA) that defines what we can and can’t do with the media and software we spend money on, but do not own as property.</p><p class=\"\">The focus on music clarifies the differences between&nbsp;<em>ownership</em>&nbsp;versus a&nbsp;<em>license</em>&nbsp;to use something. Also, music was the first powerful media industry to be deeply threatened by downloadable digital media, followed by film/video, and then publishing. The last twenty years have yielded interesting shifts and now things feel roughly stabilized for the moment.</p><h2>New Collections, New Media?</h2><p class=\"\">So far, this discussion yields a few difficult-to-answer questions: Can accessibility be a part of collecting art or is it in opposition to what attracts people to collecting? Will people still be interested in art if it’s not exclusive or a marker of status? Will the existing audience for collecting art shift or does a new kind of collection require building a new audience? Can or should the audience for collecting art scale to millions of people?</p><p class=\"\">The kinds of collecting that people broadly engage with like music, cards, and comics are only possible when the work is&nbsp;<em>mass media</em>, meaning the items that people are collecting are in unlimited or large distributions. This kind of collecting might only work with things that are&nbsp;<em>property</em>&nbsp;and not&nbsp;<em>licensed</em>, as outlined above. The people who collect these things need to have the rights to sell them, to trade them, and to give them to others.</p><p class=\"\">Some visual artists who work with media such as video and software look to this type of collecting with envy, but with conflicted feelings. These artists want anyone who would like to collect the work to be able to have it, but they also realize the advantages of the gallery system that is in direct opposition to this goal. On one hand, artists don’t want barriers of cost to prevent people from collecting the work, but artists are often specific about how to control the presentation of the work. For example, some works need to be viewed in precise lighting conditions and at a specific scale. A work with these requirements isn’t mass media, but is created for a unique physical space that can only be created within a controlled environment, as in a gallery or museum. The traditional gallery system also supports its artists through administration — taking care of sales, paperwork, promotion, shipping logistics and press communication. These services can only exist with a regular flow of sales of unique or editioned works with a high price point.</p><p class=\"\">In theory, an artist might decide to make one work for a gallery and another work for mass distribution. This decision could be different for each work created, but this decision isn’t possible with traditional visual art that has an “original.” This is the essential difference with creating works that are digital media. With digital media, each so-called&nbsp;<em>copy</em>&nbsp;is identical to the so-called&nbsp;<em>original</em>. The very idea of an&nbsp;<em>original</em>&nbsp;with digital work isn’t applicable. Each copy is simultaneously as original and not-original as all the others. Therefore, an artist who works with digital media could have the option to make work for the gallery&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;to make mass media works that can be collected in an accessible way, but in practice this choice doesn’t exist.</p><p class=\"\">At the present moment, an artist who creates works in mass media has the option to either make work available through a gallery or to publish the work for free and open online access. It’s true, there have been many initiatives to provide a third option over the last two decades, but they have either failed in succession or have not had a broad impact. I think these disappointments are the result of the inability to develop a base of collectors and this is partially a&nbsp;<em>platform</em>&nbsp;issue where existing technologies don’t support what people want. If the platforms do evolve and a collector base is nurtured, is it even possible for an artist to work in both ways? Can an artist succeed at playing the gallery game and making work that is financially accessible for a wider audience? Can an artist avoid galleries entirely, make only digital mass-media work, and still support themselves?</p><p class=\"\">The social and emotional shift required for people to start collecting digital art, as they do music, feels like the difficult part, while the technical aspect is now possible. One way to manage the logistics is a&nbsp;<em>blockchain</em>, a frequently hyped and misunderstood set of technologies. At its most simple, a blockchain is a list. The blockchain innovation is the way the transactions are verified so they are confirmed to be accurate. A blockchain is open for anyone to read and it is distributed so everyone can access the data. The blockchain is the key to moving away from&nbsp;<em>licenses</em>&nbsp;toward&nbsp;<em>property</em>&nbsp;for digital media because the information is accurate and it isn’t centralized. Further, a blockchain can record loans and a history of sales transactions for a work. The provenance of the work is public and it’s guaranteed to be accurate; it can’t be forged.</p><p class=\"\">As an example, an artist might decide to release a digital photograph to be collected. This photo can be a unique work or an edition of any number. The process starts by entering data about the work: title, medium, size, year, edition size, etc. This data, as well as a unique distillation of the photograph file is recorded into the blockchain. This “unique distillation” is called a&nbsp;<em>hash</em>&nbsp;or more colloquially a&nbsp;<em>digital fingerprint</em>. At this point, a record of the photo exists as a piece of property that can be transferred. If the decision is made to release an edition of ten, there are ten unique pieces of property. If a decision is made to release an edition of 2000, there are 2000 unique pieces of property. As the creator, the artist can then transfer the ownership to someone as a gift or can transfer the ownership to someone who buys it. This transaction need not be done personally or “by hand.” Software can automate this through a website or application, or an authorized representative can take care of the transactions. Once the change in ownership is recorded into the blockchain, the new owner has all of the rights to sell it, loan it, etc.</p><p class=\"\">It’s important to clarify that the file itself, the artwork, can be copied and shared with others outside of the blockchain. A blockchain is unrelated to copy protection or digital rights management (DRM.) The blockchain keeps track of the transactions, but it doesn’t constrain what happens to the file; this is up to the owner. For example, if someone sells a digital photograph and that transfer of ownership is recorded into a blockchain, the original owner loses her rights to ownership, but she can keep a copy of the file. (There are ways to change this, but that is separate from the blockchain.) The new owner can do whatever she wants with the file, including the decision to copy it as many times as she wants and to distribute those copies. The people who have these copies are not the owners of the work.</p><p class=\"\">This is a new kind of possession that requires a shift in ideas. One way to think about it is similar to how copyright works. Imagine a poem that is under copyright. Anyone might gain access to the poem in a book at the library or through the internet, but only the owner has the right to grant distribution, among other things. With the photograph example, other people might have a copy of the photo, but they don’t hold the rights of ownership for that image.</p><h2>A Forking Path</h2><p class=\"\">There are two broad ways that collecting digital media might develop. One direction mirrors the existing art world through selling unique or exclusive things. This is the traditional, conservative model where a digital media file is sold as a unique artwork or as a small edition. This could be selling unique digital artifacts for a high price or an edition of a few hundred. This thinking is preceded by markets for printed work on the high end including lithographs and etchings in editions that make them more affordable than unique paintings and drawings. Numerous examples of this model for selling digital media are under development by individual artists and by venture-capital-funded initiatives. This might be a good business model if it works, but it’s not transformative for artists, the arts, or for society. It might broaden the possibility for more people to collect art, specifically digital art, but it remains exclusive. While this model will hopefully succeed and it will support artists, there’s an alternate opportunity.</p><p class=\"\">The unique material of digital media presents a new opportunity for collecting that wasn’t possible with prior forms of visual art. This is only possible with digital media because of the absence of an original and the condition that all copies appear to be identical. As a hybrid between unique objects and the unique qualities of digital objects, each “identical” digital copy can have a unique and verifiable digital signature. Therefore, each version can look and perform interchangeably, but each is singular. Each version can be registered, bought, sold, loaned, and traded as a unique object, and importantly, each can be accurately verified. This supports a new model of collecting digital media where an edition can be sold in large numbers for lower cost or a large number of unique works can be managed, but each still includes all of the traditional rights of ownership. For example, edition 132/500 or edition 5243/20000 can be bought, recorded, and verified. In a different direction, an artist can produce any number of unique works in a series. To use an older idea from photography, imagine each image on a contact sheet can be sold as a unique work. Or, more likely, a set of images edited from a few rolls of film. The logistics of doing this were prohibitive with analog media, but digital media can fully support it. As another example, imagine a piece of software that generates images. Each of these images could be offered as a unique work within a series, rather the more traditional model of editioning only one of those files.</p><p class=\"\">There are other unique elements to collecting digital media that weren’t possible until recently. To recede back to music for one final comparison, the thing that made collecting music on records and tapes possible was the accessibility of playback hardware. For that media to be collected, there needed to be a way to experience it. For example, record players were available in a range from inexpensive models to exotic devices for audiophiles, but access to listening to vinyl was possible on an individual, family, or community scale. At the time collecting records was emerging, digital media did not yet exist. It has only been in the last few decades that digital media playback hardware has become accessible and high-enough quality to engage large groups of artists to create work for it. Hardware that plays digital media files recently shifted in a positive direction with the development of slim, high-resolution flat screen technologies and more powerful home media players, including video game systems and hardware embedded directly into televisions. Now, millions of people have easy access to digital media files through the internet that can be experienced through mobile phones, tablets, and new kinds of televisions. In addition to the devices that people already have, there’s a growing number of hardware manufacturers who are focusing specifically on designing screens for the display of digital art.</p><p class=\"\">To have a broad impact, a new model of collecting media art will need to be extremely accessible. It will need to work broadly across cultures, incomes, and age; it needs to be approachable for millions of people. This new model will need to be decentralized. It must support diverse groups curating and selling work without centralized control. The proprietary “store” systems created by contemporary tech giants are the opposite of what is needed. Individuals and small groups should be able to create their own “galleries” or “labels” and individual artists should have the freedom to release and control their own work directly.</p><p class=\"\">As long as artists continue to live within capitalist economies, a new form of collecting digital media will need to provide financial support for the artists that participate. It will still be an option for artists to post work online without compensation, but an alternative should exist for people who want to pursue it. The entrenched gallery system doesn’t support this kind of work and the model of finding grants, fellowships and commissions for digital work supports too few. Similarly, some artists have been successful on different crowdsourcing platforms, but those systems and audiences favor a narrow range of practices and sensibilities. Artists who create digital media do not have enough opportunities to support themselves with their work.</p><h2>The Dematerialization of the Art Object</h2><p class=\"\">Today, even though art is still associated with wealth and traditional media, the need for either to be required for art was dismantled deep within the twentieth century. With certainty, it can be asserted that the status of an&nbsp;<em>object as art</em>&nbsp;is unrelated to scarcity, cost, or materials. It’s time to proceed with what was started many decades ago. Artists have long used mass media and have explored new materials. For example, it’s been over fifty years since On Kawara started the&nbsp;<em>I Got Up</em>&nbsp;series by sending postcards stating the time he woke up each day and twenty-seven years since Felix Gonzalez-Torres placed a pile of candy in the corner for the museum audience to take for his&nbsp;<em>Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)&nbsp;</em>The spirit and legacy of Dada, Fluxus, and net.art remain relevant today.</p><p class=\"\">It’s time to build on those ideas and to move forward, rather than to regress or maintain nostalgia for the power relationships and dependencies of patronage and exclusion. In the future, a native digital media collecting ecology might be radically different from the current art market, but this new kind of collecting probably won’t affect the existing market. The current art market is a niche that will continue to evolve, but not in this direction. If a new model succeeds, it will emerge as new territory.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p class=\"\">Thank you to Sean Moss-Pultz and Casey Alt for an exchange of ideas on this topic over a number of years.

What many people may not know about <em>American Gothic</em> is that the woman in the painting is the artist’s sister, and the man was actually not Wood’s brother-in-law, but his dentist. So this iconic couple were never actually a couple at all, but that did not stop us from wondering what it would look like if they had a child that grew into an adult.

Okay - let’s start here. Right now you have a digital twin for every photograph ever taken of you in the past, or that will ever be taken of you in the future. These twins exists in a near-infinite matrix of possible faces (called latent space) produced by a deep-learning algorithm developed by Nvidia called <a href=\"https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan\">StyleGAN</a>. </p><p class=\"\">Like all GANs (generative adversarial networks), StyleGAN is comprised of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. In this case, Nvidia trained the generator on 70,000 high-quality images of human faces at 1024×1024 resolution taken from Flickr until it was able to fool the discriminator into believing the images it produced were real human faces. You have probably already seen projects that use this model like <a href=\"https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/\"><span><em>This Person Does Not Exist</em></span></a><span>,</span> which became very popular earlier this year.</p><p class=\"\">Reben’s project is interesting to me for two reasons. First, it focuses more on the ability to perform mathematical functions on the faces, and second, it personalizes this technology by finding and cross-breeding images that look like the participants in his photo booth.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In other words, seeing hyper-realistic faces of people that don’t really exist is cool, but discovering I have infinite digital twins that can breed to make offspring with everyone else’s digital twins… well, that is much cooler in my book!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">As an example, here is one of my digital twins:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566767266199-MWG46VVZHX1VZTBFCIHU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKYBlG5uyCc6T2nEw9BEsb5Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxwlB3Nyru_nTzLL0hKb5ewnXVRdh0H_hghPx_hhF1li_Cb2PLhCXpbAQQtcQzq69M/Jason_Bailey_Latent_Space.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"718x354\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Jason_Bailey_Latent_Space.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d6c307dc6d439000166d195\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566767266199-MWG46VVZHX1VZTBFCIHU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKYBlG5uyCc6T2nEw9BEsb5Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxwlB3Nyru_nTzLL0hKb5ewnXVRdh0H_hghPx_hhF1li_Cb2PLhCXpbAQQtcQzq69M/Jason_Bailey_Latent_Space.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">The image on the left is a photo I took with my phone and sent to Alex;

Reben calls the project Latent Face, and according to him, “It looks into the stylegan flicker model for the latent vector closest to the input (which is two or more images of faces), then the vectors are operated on to find the midpoint vector and produce the output.” That’s a fancy way of saying it creates something of an average from the two or more faces provided as inputs to produce a convincing-looking digital offspring. \nGrant Wood, American Gothic - 1930\nAs an art history nerd, I of course had to ask Alex if it was possible to cross-breed painted portraits. He obliged, and his results are pretty great. \nFirst up, Grant Wood’s American Gothic, maybe the most iconic double portrait of all time. What many people may not know about American Gothic is that the woman in the painting is the artist’s sister, and the man was actually not Wood’s brother-in-law, but his dentist. So this iconic couple were never actually a couple at all, but that did not stop us from wondering what it would look like if they had a child that grew into an adult. You can see the results below and the animation at the top of this post.\nGrant Wood, detail from American Gothic - 1930\nGrant Wood, detail from American Gothic - 1930\nAlex Reben, American Gothic Hybrid\nOne of my favorite real-life artist couples is Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. It is well-documented in her work and her journals that Frida had always wanted to have a child with her husband Diego. Tragically, Kahlo suffered horrific injuries in a bus accident when she was just 18 that made that difficult. \nI asked Alex if we could find the latent vector between the striking self-portraits of Kahlo and Rivera below.\nLeft: Frida Kahlo, Self-Portrait with Monkey - 1938; Right; Diego Rivera, Self-Portrait - 1949\nAlexander Reben, Midpoint between Kahlo and Rivera self-portraits\nYou can see the animation moving through latent space between the two self-portraits below.\nRegular Artnome readers may recall that we averaged every painting by Van Gogh into a single image. For that image, Artnome data scientist Kyle Waters set the aspect ratio for all the portraits to the same dimensions and averaged out the color for each pixel location. It produced the ghostly-looking portrait below. \nKyle Waters, Average van Gogh Portrait\nUnlike Water’s pixel average portrait, Reben’s averages (or more precisely, midpoint images) from StyleGAN are creating entirely new facial structures, not just averages of pixel color values. In this way, it feels more like breeding paintings than creating a visual average. Reben pointed out that, “You can often see this in the hair and facial hair, which many times is a different style than either of the two input images.”\nVincent van Gogh,\nVincent van Gogh,\nAlexander Reben,\nSo how does this all work?

Many believed that because photography involved chemicals and machinery instead of the “human hand and spirit,” it could not be considered on par with drawing and painting. Instead, photography was seen as being closer to the fabrics being mass produced by machines in the mills than it was to the fine arts. The influential French poet and art critic <a href=\"https://www.csus.edu/indiv/o/obriene/art109/readings/11%20Baudelaire%20Photography.htm\"><span>Charles Baudelaire</span></a> even worried that photography would erode the very foundation of the fine arts:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">As the photographic industry was the refuge of every would-be painter, every painter too ill-endowed or too lazy to complete his studies, this universal infatuation bore not only the mark of a blindness, an imbecility, but had also the air of a vengeance. I do not believe, or at least I do not wish to believe, in the absolute success of such a brutish conspiracy, in which, as in all others, one finds both fools and knaves; but I am convinced that the ill-applied developments of photography, like all other purely material developments of progress, have contrib­uted much to the impoverishment of the French artistic genius, which is already so scarce.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">Just a few years after making this bold anti-photography statement Baudelaire’s stance on photography must have softened a bit as he chose to sit for the photographer Étienne Carjat for the portrait shown below. It would, however, take more than one hundred years before a popular market for photography as fine art would develop.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566138804940-CX4AJ8IR6FLXSZ81OVPR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJYiwc7O1MEdP-vUODInoGJ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0p5uBJOnOmCWBN4JfYsIDyR_oyru7nqddy0XnTWu6C89dCtWaLW74oWWtO--V3abKg/E%CC%81tienne_Carjat%2C_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire%2C_circa_1862.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x3157\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Étienne Carjat,  Charles Baudelaire      - 1863\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d5a959bb04c87000109e307\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566138804940-CX4AJ8IR6FLXSZ81OVPR/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJYiwc7O1MEdP-vUODInoGJ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0p5uBJOnOmCWBN4JfYsIDyR_oyru7nqddy0XnTWu6C89dCtWaLW74oWWtO--V3abKg/E%CC%81tienne_Carjat%2C_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire%2C_circa_1862.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Étienne Carjat, <em>Charles Baudelaire</em><strong><em> </em></strong>- 1863</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">In the early 1950s, photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, often referred to with reverence as “the father of photojournalism,” published his book <em>The Decisive Moment</em>. In it, he differentiates photography from painting by pointing out that painting can be slowly worked over time in contrast to the photographer, who is capturing a precise moment which will never be reproduced or occur in the same way again. As an extension of this ethos, Cartier-Bresson was against manipulation and cropping of photographs in the darkroom. The art of photography was in the framing of unique events in real time through the camera’s view finder, not in the manipulation of chemicals and machinery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566142831674-B4IFZ6XRFXSQ0CY9S0R5/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKBkzYmWvUaomiCXzolEjMEUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2s_q0uUctAmAfPhiGyAT2hBdnEk9uVjp-BWkF3aPh3_GbhuOb0MAcXaQ6whlEkpec/ICP_HCB_pressimage_16-770x1127.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"770x1127\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Henri Cartier-Bresson,  Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare  - 1932\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d5a959bb04c87000109e30a\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566142831674-B4IFZ6XRFXSQ0CY9S0R5/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKBkzYmWvUaomiCXzolEjMEUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2s_q0uUctAmAfPhiGyAT2hBdnEk9uVjp-BWkF3aPh3_GbhuOb0MAcXaQ6whlEkpec/ICP_HCB_pressimage_16-770x1127.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Henri Cartier-Bresson, <em>Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare</em> - 1932</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">As Cartier-Bresson shared in a 1957 interview in <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\"><em>Photography is not like painting. There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera.</em></p><p class=\"\"><em>That is the moment the photographer is creative. Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever.</em></p></blockquote><p class=\"\">Against this popular conception of photography as means of faithfully capturing fleeting moments of reality, and decades before a popular market for photography as fine art would emerge, a group of radical photographers posed a direct challenge to Cartier-Bresson’s notion of the “decisive moment.” They created non-representational photographs that could be mechanically reproduced through a series of algorithmic actions. Rather than capture moments of reality, these photographers were producing their own realities or “aesthetic states” through mechanical and chemical manipulation. Though they owed a debt to concrete art with its strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction, these photographers were more influenced by media theory, cybernetics, and semiotics than the traditional art history and art theory of their time. They borrowed the term “generative” from German semiotician Max Bense’s book, <em>Generative Aesthetics,</em> to describe their approach, eventually settling in on “generative photography”. The generative photographers developed repeatable programs for photographic image making which predated and then evolved side by side with early generative computer-based art.</p><p class=\"\">While generative photographers like Gottfried Jäger, Herbert W. Franke, and Hein Gravenhorst may not be household names yet, they should be. I believe <a href=\"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art\">generative art</a> is the most important art of our generation as it makes the digital revolution visible and best reflects all that separates us from those who came before us. First through photography and then through computers, the ideas and work of these artists form the foundations for all of generative art. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566177810901-I29CZILXC1WP0HHA8DAQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKhrJLRIA4vb-bqxB-4cbgF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmqpkWVB1Wnu9WKh97EMRsSLBwJyp9uvOcY3RnNY2J59qRFG3ahEXd__cg_YT4LHKU/16-2016-GJ-Foto-anonym.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1200x1734\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Porträt Gottfried Jäger , Paris photo - 2017 - photographer unknown\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d5a959bb04c87000109e30d\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566177810901-I29CZILXC1WP0HHA8DAQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKhrJLRIA4vb-bqxB-4cbgF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmqpkWVB1Wnu9WKh97EMRsSLBwJyp9uvOcY3RnNY2J59qRFG3ahEXd__cg_YT4LHKU/16-2016-GJ-Foto-anonym.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><em>Porträt Gottfried Jäger</em>, Paris photo - 2017 - photographer unknown</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">One reason you may not know of these great pioneers is that although they were prolific and have written hefty volumes of theory explaining their approach, few of these books have been translated into English. We are seeing renewed interest in this work, with several generative photographers having been shown in the recent exhibition <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/shape-light\"><em>Shape of Light</em> </a>at the Tate Gallery London and in the current show <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/current-exhibition\"><em>Automat und Mensch</em></a> at the Kate Vass Galerie in Zurich. I was lucky enough to co-curate the latter show with generative photography expert Georg Bak. It was through Bak that I learned of these pioneers and their important contributions. Bak has had the foresight to interview these important artists while they are still available to shed light on their important work and contributions to the history of generative art.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">What follows is the first of several important interviews between Georg Bak and the early pioneers of generative photography. In this interview, Bak  speaks with Gottfried Jäger, who is credited with naming the movement “generative photography” and is one of its most important practitioners. We at Artnome are thrilled to feature Bak’s interview with Jäger in English for an audience who may not otherwise learn of his important work and the ideas behind the origins of generative photography and the generative art movement. </p><h2><strong>Interview with Gottfried Jäger by Georg Bak</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566139968029-1VL6Z8AZP0P8ORV36GHW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kChI_hseRyfVRpqaBCNRbOV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTm4RUJcHyv48q2B9UErnMKJQkG00ADrnoOqAULF0TWc1clp9eMu46lngbnF6fOH5iB/Jager.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1434x1997\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Gottfried Jäger presents his pinhole structure 3.8.14 F 2.6, 1967, b/w camera - photograph by Ursel Jäger\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d5a959bb04c87000109e310\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566139968029-1VL6Z8AZP0P8ORV36GHW/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kChI_hseRyfVRpqaBCNRbOV7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTm4RUJcHyv48q2B9UErnMKJQkG00ADrnoOqAULF0TWc1clp9eMu46lngbnF6fOH5iB/Jager.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Gottfried Jäger presents his pinhole structure 3.8.14 F 2.6, 1967, b/w camera - photograph by Ursel Jäger</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">Georg Bak (GB): In the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.katevassgalerie.com/current-exhibition\"><em>Automat und Mensch</em></a>, we have curated a show around artificial intelligence within its art historical context.

It was written by an engineer, and his language was congruent to mine, both being knowledgeable about new technology in those days. This book got me familiar with the term \"information,\" which helped me to get away from the myth of the \"Geistigen\" (spiritual) and metaphysics in art. Steinbuch stated:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">What we are observing regarding intellectual functions is reception, processing, and transfer of information... It isn't evident or likely at all that you need further requirements than physics in order to explain intellectual functions. </p></blockquote><p class=\"\">According to this statement, a human brain and a hand weren't necessary anymore for an artistic expression. It could be also a technical apparatus. A camera or a computer were capable of achieving intellectual results. Nowadays these kind of questions have become obsolete and photography is undoubtedly acknowledged as a form of art. But in those days it was not the case, and it had to be legitimized and justified.</p><p class=\"\">GB: Another book that you often talked about is <em>Kunst und Konstruktion</em> by one of the earliest pioneers of computer art, Herbert W. Franke, with whom you are still befriended.

That little book from 1957 published at F. Bruckmann in Munich instantly woke my interest. It was not only the title and a nice cover of the book, but especially its subtitle, <em>Physik und Mathematik als fotografisches Experiment</em> (<em>Physics and Mathematics as a Photographic Experiment</em>). That was a credo, a program. And nowadays I realize: This approach has led my way throughout my whole career as an artist.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566139552293-GSU8DIDUVUI33A1NTTKI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMgeWUAlZzqYWfPNWlMZudJ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0ouw-8l5B_J38LMU7OZFvYcbYJVmof8Q5NJJ-gzalNmZYBOnHcNF_KLO7X5adVE7dQ/2-1957%28c.%29-Franke%3AHu%CC%88bner-S-38%3A39.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1811\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Double page 38/39 from  Kunst und Konstruktion : (l.): Herbert W.

Franke and Andreas Hübner. But a few years later in 1966 during my summer vacation at Bodensee, I decided to contact Herbert W. Franke and asked for an appointment ... granted! This was followed by an exciting first meeting in Wolfratshausen near Munich. We became friends and have been cooperating on several occasions. The first results of our cooperation were the exhibition <em>Generative Fotografie </em>in 1968 and the book <em>Apparative Kunst. Vom Kaleidoskop zum Computer</em>, which we had published together in 1973 with DuMont in Cologne and had gained wide international recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566139642905-RW45FP9A4I2F02W2ZE25/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kCk_-hienlJyzV4OhZFU0-R7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmH-tYLEkWkVYtHhzhW3GfDVqmdL72t_xoyL4zVsvq6XarEayzFWskCSpPciomRUiw/3-1958-GJ-o-T-Gummiring.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"1383x2078\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Gottfried Jäger:  Untitled ,  Hommage à H.

Can you share with us how you came up with this exhibition and what the reaction was within the art scene at that time?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">GJ: Let me tell you the whole story. In 1965 I was invited to show my \"Lichtgrafiken\" (light graphics) at the group show <em>Fotografie '65</em> in Bruges. I was visiting the show alongside some students of my class at Werkkunstschule Bielefeld. Although the succinct title of the show wouldn't suggest any specific expectations, this exhibition was a counter-reaction to another exhibition taking place at the same time, also in Bruges, an exhibition organized by Karl Pawek in conjunction with the German magazine by Stern,<em>Weltausstellung der Photographie: Was ist der Mensch</em>. While the latter was the \"grand opera,\" our show <em>Fotografie '65</em> was rather a chamber concert. A sensational realism was countered by a radical formalism. This is how we experienced it on spot and how I later featured it in the article <em>Signale eines neuen Programms</em> at the art magazine <em>Foto-Prisma</em>. Some works that captured my attention were landscape studies by the Belgian artists Yves Auquie and Robert Besard, close-ups by Anton Dries, nudes by the Swiss artist René Mächler, and especially the filigrane \"chemigrams\" by Pierre Cordier and the elegant \"photograms\" by Kilian Breier, as well as the \"Lichtstrukturen\" (light structures) by Roger Humbert. The latter inspired me to organize my own group exhibition with a special focus on the formative potential - concrete as well as constructive - of photography. This was the moment when the idea was born to organize an exhibition titled <em>Generative Fotografie</em> which would take place three years later at Kunsthaus Bielefeld.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566140076883-PLJ9NA1H6ZF9FCK6K373/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMSv8oOf8F4OOFTCn7kENLJ7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0prfa1Z6IeUrCPboCAmmHZlNf1Z5UBsRaOHhN9mAVK1w2B3Q4hsuK3EhnmQaCbkwTg/5-1965-Bense.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x3370\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Max Bense:  Aesthetica.

I presented him my \"Lochblendenstrukturen\" (pinhole structures) alongside some photographic works by Kilian Breier, Pierre Cordier, and Hein Gravenhorst. Surprisingly, he instantly agreed to make this exhibition happen in January, 1968, and it was to become the last show at the beautiful Kunsthaus Bielefeld. Soon after, the building was torn down and instead the Bielefeld Kunsthalle was built at another place.</p><p class=\"\">For the title of the show, I was inspired by the last chapter of the book <em>Aesthetica</em> by Max Bense. His theories were summarized under the title <em>Projekte generativer Ästhetik</em>. The following sentences were seminal for me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">Generative aesthetics is an aesthetic by creation. It allows a methodical creation of aesthetic states by dissecting the creation in a finite number of specifiable and describable single steps.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">So basically it was not about creating \"high art,\" but about generating \"aesthetic states.\" This was a key element for a new discipline in the art. I called up Herbert W. Franke and asked him for his opinion regarding the exhibition title <em>Generative Fotografie</em>, and spontaneously he thought, \"It sounds good.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566140212297-6ZMSQ1HU0O6NUXH36MEZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHuHPbqIjjSZ33qpHVF884N7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UeVxsH1EO3aVQxPrBctoX28FmRNM8wrcPt6dhnuWoVPJG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/7-1968-Gen-Fotogr-Einladungskarte.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2441x1506\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Generative Fotografie , invitation card for the exhibition at Kunsthaus Bielefeld, 1968, designed by Heinz Baier\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d5a959bb04c87000109e322\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566140212297-6ZMSQ1HU0O6NUXH36MEZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHuHPbqIjjSZ33qpHVF884N7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UeVxsH1EO3aVQxPrBctoX28FmRNM8wrcPt6dhnuWoVPJG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/7-1968-Gen-Fotogr-Einladungskarte.png?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\"><em>Generative Fotografie</em>, invitation card for the exhibition at Kunsthaus Bielefeld, 1968, designed by Heinz Baier</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">The exhibition was quite successful. Local press reacted in a rather positive way. Even such prominent artist colleagues such as Otto Steinert affirmed during a board meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photographie (German Society for Photography) which took place in the exhibition space of <em>Generative Fotografie</em>. Follow-up exhibitions around this topic took place at Galerie Spektrum in Hannover, in Antwerp, and at other places. The studies class of Kilian Breier from HFBK Hamburg came to visit the show. Among the students was Karl Martin Holzhäuser, a later colleague and friend of mine at Fachhochschule Bielefeld (Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences). But it was only after the manifesto-like book <em>Generative Fotografie</em> from 1975 which I co-published with Holzhäuser and Franke when theory of this art movement became more widespread in the broad public.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566140727718-EI7JJ5JNME8C6WSR97YU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIHjW4L_FvD_dDf_0CmCumF7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0j7auEjv-0kJ6zCyNtanbYpQEYtnFFnhOlRwntw6Tfm6UFkUeXT5gq7jDgSywPYhRA/8-1968-Ausst-Gen-Fot.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1693\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Exhibition view of  Generative Fotografie  at Kunsthaus Bielefeld, 1968; included works by Kilian Breier (l.), Pierre Cordier, Hein Gravenhorst (l.) and Gottfried Jäger (r.; curator); catalogue text by Herbert W.

Looking back in art history from our perspective, wouldn't it be almost evident that generative photography was the origin or source of digital photography?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">GJ: I have already mentioned the definition of generative aesthetics by Max Bense. We discovered therein a new artistic approach in the handling of photographic techniques. Nowadays the term is widely acknowledged and can be retrospectively seen as an early artistic form from the mid-1960s, which was exploring for the first time the synthesis between light images and data images, an interplay between cameras and computers. The imagery was on an abstract level, without any reference to objects or symbolic signs. It was all about generating aesthetic states, where natural analog media (light, camera, light-sensitive support) and mathematical instruments (number, computer, program) were interacting.</p><p class=\"\">But I have to clarify that in the early days, generative photography was not made with computers. They were primarily light images made through experimental photography. But we have connected the techniques with the methods of computers, meaning numeric programs. Our method was also a rejection of the single image and the \"decisive moment\" (Cartier-Bresson) towards a serial and logically reproducible work series.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566140873629-283U3NP6HZIDP2UHPMIE/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kELGXgMTsymL4ATHCOPcat17gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UTWrxxKGWc_QMoP9bMLXbOPEPkLryd-dUCGBORZlR7VlpJmyJuPnROfkv0UjH_ecUA/9-1968-Gu%CC%88nter-Rudolf-Ursel%3AGottfr-Ja%CC%88ger-Blfld-Fenstergalerie-Obernstr.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"1760x2490\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Ursel and Gottfried Jäger with “pinhole structures” (Lochblendenstrukturen), 1967, from the exhibition  Generative Fotografie ; photograph by Günter Rudolf, 1968\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5d5a959bb04c87000109e328\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566140873629-283U3NP6HZIDP2UHPMIE/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kELGXgMTsymL4ATHCOPcat17gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UTWrxxKGWc_QMoP9bMLXbOPEPkLryd-dUCGBORZlR7VlpJmyJuPnROfkv0UjH_ecUA/9-1968-Gu%CC%88nter-Rudolf-Ursel%3AGottfr-Ja%CC%88ger-Blfld-Fenstergalerie-Obernstr.jpg?format=1000w\" />\n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Ursel and Gottfried Jäger with “pinhole structures” (Lochblendenstrukturen), 1967, from the exhibition <em>Generative Fotografie</em>; photograph by Günter Rudolf, 1968</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\">My first definition of generative photography reads as follows:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">\"Generating aesthetic structures on the basis of predefined programs which are processed through photo-chemical, photo-optical, or photo-technical operations in order to achieve an ideal and functional connection within all involved elements that form the composition of the aesthetic structure.\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">This was the opposite to \"subjective photography\" (Steinert) or \"totale photographie\" (Pawek).

We contributed with lectures and publications as well as presentation of our artworks in exhibitions. So for example, Gravenhorst and myself were exhibiting in Zagreb, and we also took part at the symposium. Kage and Breier were both part of the ZERO group. Nevertheless, the art establishment didn't truly take notice.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Regarding the acknowledgement of our work (generative photography) as a legitimate form of art, we had to fight on two levels against the perception of \"photography as illegitimate art\" (Bourdieu, 1983). It was only in 1984 when photographs were being accepted legally as works of visual art according to German copyright law. On the other hand there was a general skepticism whether computers could be regarded as an artistic medium. The rather cold outputs of computer art couldn't withhold the traditional conception of high art. So as photographers, we were basically not regarded as real artists, and as generative photographers, we were not regarded as real photographers.</p><p class=\"\">GB: Was there a market for computer art? Who were the collectors and gallerists dealing with that type of art?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">GJ: In the 1960s, there didn't exist a significant market for generative art. For photography it was Käthe Schroeder who opened Galerie Clarissa, the first gallery for photography in Germany. This gallery also specialized in experimental and generative art. When she donated her collection to the Kestner Museum in Hannover in 1968, the list of included artists was almost an encyclopedia of the avantgarde movement in photography in the 1960s. Among the artists were Théodore Bally, Monika von Boch, Hein Gravenhorst, Heinz Hajek-Halke, Roger Humbert, Manfred Kage, Gottfried and Ursel Jäger, René Mächler, Floris Neusüss, Heinrich Riebesehl - just to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">GB: In the exhibition \"Automat und Mensch,\" we are presenting a series of your pinhole structures from 1967.

My friend and IT engineer Peter Serocka, at that time director at the visual laboratory of the mathematical faculty at University of Bielefeld, has developed a computer program based upon my optical system of two superposed pinhole structures - which he called matrices - which enabled him to imitate my pinhole structures. At the same time I shockingly became aware by reading a magazine that, independently from us, a Japanese group of mathematicians came up with the same results. So we got in touch with each other and we started a fruitful technological exchange with them, which resulted in reciprocal publications. This was basically my first access into my artistic practices with computers.</p><p class=\"\">It was high time to deal with the new system also practically and not only theoretically. And as it is often the case when a historical shift of a system takes place, the shift started again through imitation and simulation of the pre-existing. I tied in with the pinhole structures and edited them with inherent instruments of computer technology and developed new image orders. Nowadays I am working in a hybrid way, a mix between conventional photographic techniques as well as cybernetic, computer-based instruments.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">GB: In the beginning of generative photography, it was difficult to categorize this new form of photography while in Europe, especially, two main directions of photography were dominating the discourse on photography. On the one side there was subjective photography and the Otto Steinert school; on the other side, Karl Pawek's conception of documentary photography. You mentioned to me several times that leading art theorists were rather suspicious about generative photography. Retrospectively, one can say that generative aesthetics is widely used as a term among contemporary artists. Can we say that generative photography has finally entered into the art historical canon?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">GJ: I have already referred to these two names in a previous question. Both were antipodes at the time when I developed the idea of generative photography. On the other hand, they also enhanced a disruptive evolution. Nowadays it is almost unimaginable how intense these grave battles between the two sides of realism and formalism, between document and experiment, were waged. It was a power struggle for interpretive sovereignty of what photography fundamentally was - its ontology - assuming that it would be possible to define this ambiguous notion exclusively.</p><p class=\"\">An important step in the evolution on the subject was the exhibition <em>Ungegenständliche Fotografie</em> in Basel in 1960, which led to the exhibition <em>Konkrete Fotografie</em> in Bern in 1967, organized by an independent group of four Swiss artists referring to their idea of a self-referential form of photography to \"concrete painting\" (van Doesburg, 1930) and the Swiss concrete artists (Max Bill, etc.). One year later this was followed by the exhibition <em>Generative Fotografie</em> in Bielefeld. This is a short review of the history.</p><p class=\"\">Nowadays the term \"generative photography\" can be found in almost every encyclopedia on photography. Currently, it will be used in the context of \"pre-digital art,\" mentioned as such in the exhibition catalogue <em>Shapes of Light - 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art</em> at the Tate Modern in London in 2018. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            <img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd/1566141655916-AH0U7VNCR3633AT8P1YZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/15b-2018-LBS-Tate-UMertens_180430_064.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1667\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"Exhibition view  Shape of Light. 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art  at Tate Modern, London 2018.

I could add to it a few names and thoughts. Based on Noam Chomsky's \"generative grammar\" as well as the thoughts on \"generative aesthetics\" by Max Bense and \"cybernetic aesthetics\" by Herbert W. Franke, the sources of generative photography derive not primarily - as opposed to \"concrete photography\" - from art historical sources, but rather from linguistics and philology, mostly from semiotics. My colleague from Bielefeld, Kirsten Wagner, has published an important essay in the exhibition catalogue <em>Die Bielefelder Schule. Foto Kunst im Kontext</em> in 2014: <em>Generative Ästhetik im Kontext der Bielefelder Schule.</em> This text contains a much more comprehensive answer to this question than I am capable to give you at this point. From my point of view, I would like to mention Herbert W. Franke as my first spiritus mentor and Vilém Flusser as my sharpest critic. Both have fundamentally influenced my career as an artist. I learned from Franke how to play with the machine - and from Flusser how to play against the machine. Today I would count the philosopher Lambert Wiesing and the literary theorist Bernd Stiegler among the theorists who help me on my way.</p><p class=\"\">This interview took place on 29th July 2019 in German and was translated into English by Georg Bak</p>","contentSnippet":"Gottfried Jäger, Pinhole Structures, 1967\nForeword by Jason Bailey\nIt may be hard to believe, but there was a time in the not too distant past when photography was viewed with as much prejudice and suspicion by the the art world as digital art is today. Many believed that because photography involved chemicals and machinery instead of the “human hand and spirit,” it could not be considered on par with drawing and painting. Instead, photography was seen as being closer to the fabrics being mass produced by machines in the mills than it was to the fine arts. The influential French poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire even worried that photography would erode the very foundation of the fine arts:\n\nAs the photographic industry was the refuge of every would-be painter, every painter too ill-endowed or too lazy to complete his studies, this universal infatuation bore not only the mark of a blindness, an imbecility, but had also the air of a vengeance. I do not believe, or at least I do not wish to believe, in the absolute success of such a brutish conspiracy, in which, as in all others, one finds both fools and knaves; but I am convinced that the ill-applied developments of photography, like all other purely material developments of progress, have contrib­uted much to the impoverishment of the French artistic genius, which is already so scarce.\n\nJust a few years after making this bold anti-photography statement Baudelaire’s stance on photography must have softened a bit as he chose to sit for the photographer Étienne Carjat for the portrait shown below. It would, however, take more than one hundred years before a popular market for photography as fine art would develop.\nÉtienne Carjat, Charles Baudelaire - 1863\nIn the early 1950s, photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, often referred to with reverence as “the father of photojournalism,” published his book The Decisive Moment. In it, he differentiates photography from painting by pointing out that painting can be slowly worked over time in contrast to the photographer, who is capturing a precise moment which will never be reproduced or occur in the same way again. As an extension of this ethos, Cartier-Bresson was against manipulation and cropping of photographs in the darkroom. The art of photography was in the framing of unique events in real time through the camera’s view finder, not in the manipulation of chemicals and machinery.  \nHenri Cartier-Bresson, Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare - 1932\nAs Cartier-Bresson shared in a 1957 interview in The Washington Post:\n\nPhotography is not like painting. There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera.\nThat is the moment the photographer is creative. Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever.\n\nAgainst this popular conception of photography as means of faithfully capturing fleeting moments of r...","guid":"59413d96e6f2e1c6837c7ecd:595a40576b8f5bb92c16fc18:5d5a959bb04c87000109e339","isoDate":"2019-08-20T10:49:21.000Z","itunes":{},"source":"Artnome","formattedDate":"August 20, 2019","image":""}]
